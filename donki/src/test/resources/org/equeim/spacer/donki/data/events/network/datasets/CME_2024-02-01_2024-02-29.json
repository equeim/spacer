Source is one or two eruptions together from AR 3571; one beginning around 2024-02-02T15:18Z and another shortly after around 2024-02-02T16:27Z. Both eruptions have unique flares best seen in SDO AIA 131, peaking at C3.0 at 2024-02-02T15:34Z and C3.1 at 2024-02-02T16:32Z. Both eruptions eject filament material seen well in SDO AIA 304 and GOES SUVI 304 alongside dimming, field line movement, and an EUV wave in SDO AIA 171/193/211 that may combine to contribute to this front. This CME is followed by a much slower yet brighter front that may be from the same source region, measuring <200 km/s.","submissionTime":"2024-02-03T22:03Z","versionId":2,"link":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CME/28967/-1","cmeAnalyses":[{"isMostAccurate":true,"time21_5":"2024-02-02T22:45Z","latitude":-49.0,"longitude":-50.0,"halfAngle":23.0,"speed":613.0,"type":"C","featureCode":"LE","imageType":"running difference","measurementTechnique":"SWPC_CAT","note":"Measured using the source of AR 3571 at the time of eruption and triangulation between SOHO LASCO C3 and STEREO COR2A, noting some southward deflection to get a measured longitude close to the observed longitude in SDO.
