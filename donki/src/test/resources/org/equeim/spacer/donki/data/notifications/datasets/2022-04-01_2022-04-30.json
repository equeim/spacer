For 40 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO B between about 2022-04-30T21:36Z and 2022-05-01T11:39Z (average arrival 2022-05-01T04:58Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2022-05-01T23:51Z and 2022-05-02T19:24Z (average arrival 2022-05-02T10:55Z) for 87% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally, the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-04-30T21:15Z and 2022-05-01T12:47Z (average arrival 2022-05-01T06:41Z) for 75% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 74% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-29_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129/20220429_073800_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-29_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129/20220429_073800_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-29_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129/20220429_073800_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-29_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129/20220429_073800_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-29_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129/20220429_073800_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-29_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129/20220429_073800_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129_Mars_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-29_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129/20220429_073800_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-29_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129/20220429_073800_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-29_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129/Detailed_results_20220429_073800_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX129.txt\n###\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220429-AL-005","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/19993/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-04-29T18:00Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (Mars, OSIRIS-REx, STEREO B, Parker Solar Probe, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-04-29T18:00:05Z\n## Message ID: 20220429-AL-005\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate to strong levels during this reporting period with 1 X-class flare and 8 M-class flares (see list below).  There were 7 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the combined leading edge of the S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-19T21:24Z, the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-20T04:12Z, and the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-20T02:00Z may reach Mars at 2022-04-24T08:59Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-04-23T19:00Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2022-04-22T07:03Z, and may arrive as a glancing blow at Solar Orbiter at 2022-04-22T08:00Z and Juno at 2022-05-10T01:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20220420-AL-005 and 20220420-AL-007).\n\nIt was also estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-26T14:53Z may impact STEREO B at 2022-04-30T00:05Z and may arrive as a glancing blow to NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-04-29T20:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly expected maximum Kp index is 2-4 (below minor) (see notification 20220426-AL-001). Additionally, an ensemble simulation of this CME with 48 ensemble members estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B between about 2022-04-29T21:45Z and 2022-04-30T03:30Z (average arrival 2022-04-30T01:08Z) for 39% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-04-29T16:08Z and 2022-04-29T19:29Z (average arrival 2022-04-29T18:07Z) for 10% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 99% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor) (see notification 20220427-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 4 for the reporting period.\n\nThe >2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was enhanced at the beginning of the reporting period until 2022-04-21 due to a threshold crossing in the previous reporting period at 2022-04-16T15:55Z (see notifications 20220416-AL-001, 20220416-AL-002, 20220418-AL-002, and 20220420-AL-006).  These elevated energetic electron flux levels were associated with the combined influences of the interplanetary shock at 2022-04-14T03:37Z and the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2022-04-15.  The fluxes have remained at background levels after 2022-04-21.  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux levels mentioned above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-04-20  01:09:00  01:20:00  01:14:00   M1.2   S32W86 (12992) \n2022-04-20  01:20:00  01:44:00  01:36:00   M7.2   S28W97 (12992) \n2022-04-20  03:41:00  04:04:00  03:57:00   X2.2   S28W101 (12992)\n2022-04-20  12:25:00  13:02:00  12:53:00   M1.9   S28W100 (12992)\n2022-04-21  01:47:00  02:05:00  01:59:00   M9.6   N22E23 (12993) \n2022-04-22  04:52:00  05:28:00  05:14:00   M1.1   N15E13 (12994) \n2022-04-22  13:16:00  13:30:00  13:25:00   M3.4   N22E01 (12993) \n2022-04-25  01:18:00  02:39:00  02:01:00   M1.2   N25W28 (12993) \n2022-04-25  03:52:00  04:07:00  04:02:00   M1.1   N21W34 (12993) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-04-26T14:53Z     ~714            C                24/22                26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-04-20T02:00Z     ~616            C                99/-27               36                          SOHO                              \n2022-04-20T04:12Z     ~868            C               101/-18               30                          SOHO                              \n2022-04-24T09:23Z     ~665            C              -110/-17               43                          STEREO A                          \n2022-04-24T16:48Z     ~612            C                 1/34                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-25T20:24Z     ~530            C               -95/-21               44                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-26T13:25Z     ~573            C               -90/-11               35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-04-27T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-05-03T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels throughout the outlook period.  Currently, there are nine numbered Active Regions across the Earth-facing disk.  Active Regions 12993 (N20W64) and 12994 (N16W62) have been the sources of a majority of the M-class flaring seen during the reporting period and will likely continue flaring as they rotate off of the Earth-facing disk by 2022-04-30.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor levels during the outlook period due to a coronal hole seen at the central meridian on the Earth-facing disk around 2022-04-26 that may reach a geoeffective longitudes on or around 2022-04-30.  Additionally, the possible arrival on 2022-04-29 of the CME first visible on 2022-04-26 mentioned above may possibly cause enhanced geomagnetic activity.  Finally, preliminary analysis of the combined leading edge of the C-type CME first visible at 2022-04-27T08:48Z and the C-type CME first visible at 2022-04-27T14:53Z predicts that they will reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-04-30T08:30Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 3-5 (below minor to minor) (see notification 20220427-AL-003).  Analysis of these two CMEs is still ongoing. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220427-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/19959/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-04-27T19:16Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (STEREO B, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-04-27T19:16:21Z\n## Message ID: 20220427-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO B between about 2022-04-29T21:45Z and 2022-04-30T03:30Z (average arrival 2022-04-30T01:08Z) for 39% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-04-29T16:08Z and 2022-04-29T19:29Z (average arrival 2022-04-29T18:07Z) for 10% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 99% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-26_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127/20220426_145300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-26_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127/20220426_145300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-26_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127/20220426_145300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-26_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127/20220426_145300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-26_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127/20220426_145300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-26_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127/20220426_145300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-26_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127/Detailed_results_20220426_145300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX127.txt\n\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220426-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/19946/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-04-26T19:14Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (STEREO B, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-04-26T19:14:35Z\n## Message ID: 20220426-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate to strong levels during this reporting period with 1 X-class flare and 12 M-class flares (see list below).  There were 12 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-17T03:48Z may impact STEREO A at 2022-04-19T10:09Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220417-AL-003).  This CME was also associated with an X1.1 flare from Active Region 12994 which peaked at 2022-04-17T03:34Z (see notifications 20220417-AL-001 and 20220417-AL-002).  The arrival of this CME at STEREO A may have been detected by the IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments beginning around 2022-04-19T14:00Z, but analysis of the arrival signature is still ongoing.\n\nIt was also estimated that the C-type CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-04-17T16:36Z may impact Parker Solar Probe at 2022-04-19T09:16Z and Solar Orbiter at 2022-04-19T03:12Z, and may arrive as a glancing blow at OSIRIS-REx at 2022-04-20T18:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220418-AL-001). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 6 for the reporting period.  The highest period of Kp = 6 occurred during the synoptic period 2022-04-14T15:00Z-18:00Z (see notification 20220414-AL-002) and was caused by the arrival detected at L1 of the C-type CME first observed at 2022-04-11T06:00Z (see notifications 20220411-AL-001, 20220412-AL-001), associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-04-14T03:37Z (see notification 20220414-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu beginning at 2022-04-16T15:55Z (see notifications 20220416-AL-001, 20220416-AL-002, 20220418-AL-002).  The elevated energetic electron flux levels were associated with the combined influences of the interplanetary shock at 2022-04-14T03:37Z, described above, and the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream on 2022-04-15.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to elevated energetic electron flux levels at the outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-04-15  10:31:00  11:07:00  11:01:00   M1.2   N11E95 (12994)           \n2022-04-15  11:07:00  12:29:00  11:49:00   M2.2   N10E95 (12994)           \n2022-04-15  13:47:00  14:11:00  13:59:00   M1.9   N14E95 (12994)   \n2022-04-16  14:49:00  15:09:00  14:56:00   M1.0   N22E87 (12993) \n2022-04-17  02:00:00  02:23:00  02:11:00   M1.8   N22E74 (12993) \n2022-04-17  03:17:00  03:51:00  03:34:00   X1.1   N14E73 (12994) \n2022-04-17  19:52:00  20:06:00  20:02:00   M1.5   S31W73 (12992) \n2022-04-17  22:28:00  22:40:00  22:34:00   M4.4   S31W74 (12992) \n2022-04-18  07:37:00  07:54:00  07:48:00   M1.3   S31W80 (12992) \n2022-04-18  10:04:00  10:49:00  10:27:00   M1.1   N21E55 (12993) \n2022-04-18  17:12:00  17:31:00  17:24:00   M1.9   S31W85 (12992) \n2022-04-19  04:43:00  04:59:00  04:50:00   M1.0   N22E47 (12993) \n2022-04-19  20:42:00  20:59:00  20:49:00   M3.7   S28W97 (12992) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-04-13T13:23Z     ~887            C              -163/10                56                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-04-14T09:24Z     ~599            C              -131/-11               38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-15T01:24Z     ~605            C              -117/-15               43                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-15T04:38Z     ~521            C               166/-47               20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-15T12:04Z     ~814            C              -104/-9                38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-15T13:39Z     ~660            C              -105/-18               38                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-04-16T11:54Z     ~520            C               127/30                45                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-04-16T18:54Z     ~600            C               122/27                18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-17T01:24Z     ~884            C              -177/-40               26                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-04-17T03:48Z     ~900            C               -74/-4                43                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-17T16:36Z     ~767            C               147/-16               48                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-04-18T08:39Z     ~635            C               -82/32                13                          STEREO A, SOHO\n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-04-20T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-04-26T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between moderate and strong levels throughout the outlook period.  Currently, there are seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk and at least one more unnumbered Active Region that has rotated onto the disk recently (near N24E75).  Active Region 12994 (N14E40) produced an X1.1 flare and three M-class flares during the reporting period, and Active Region 12993 (N19E36) produced four M-class flares during the reporting period. These two active regions may be expected to produce additional M-class and possibly X-class flaring during the outlook period.  Active Region 12992 (S28W99) recently rotated off the Earth-facing disk on 2022-04-19, but subsequently produced an X2.2 flare, two M-class flares, and three CMEs.\n\nOn 2022-04-20, it was estimated that the combined leading edge of the S-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-19T21:24Z, the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-20T02:00Z, and the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-20T04:12Z may impact Mars at 2022-04-24T08:59Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-04-23T19:00Z, and Parker Solar Probe at 2022-04-22T07:03Z, and may arrive as glancing blows at Solar Orbiter at 2022-04-22T08:00Z and Juno at 2022-05-10T01:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20220420-AL-005, 20220420-AL-007). The S-type CME is associated with the M3.7 flare which peaked at 2022-04-19T20:49Z. The C-type CME first observed at 2022-04-20T02:00Z is associated with the M7.2 flare which peaked at 2022-04-20T01:36Z (see notifications 20220420-AL-001, 20220420-AL-003). The C-type CME first observed at 2022-04-20T04:12Z is associated with the X2.2 flare which peaked at 2022-04-20T03:57Z (see notifications 20220420-AL-002 and 20220420-AL-004).\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period due to the previously mentioned continued radiation belt enhancement which began on 2022-04-16.  A small equatorial coronal hole crossed the Earth-facing meridian on 2022-04-20 and may become geoeffective around 2022-04-25.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220420-AL-007","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/19873/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-04-20T17:59Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs update (Juno, Mars, OSIRIS-REx, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-04-20T17:59:26Z\n## Message ID: 20220420-AL-007\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low to moderate levels during this reporting period, with 7 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first detected by STEREO A COR2 at 2022-04-11T06:00Z may affect STEREO A at 2022-04-14T07:52Z and STEREO B at 2022-04-14T11:46Z and impact NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-04-14T09:56Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 3-5 (below minor to minor) (see notification 20220411-AL-001). Additionally, an ensemble simulation of this CME with 48 ensemble members estimated that the leading edge of the CME may impact STEREO A between about 2022-04-13T22:39Z and 2022-04-14T17:30Z (average arrival 2022-04-14T07:23Z) for 95% of simulations, STEREO B between about 2022-04-14T02:46Z and 2022-04-14T18:11Z (average arrival 2022-04-14T10:27Z) for 89% of simulations, and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-04-13T23:22Z and 2022-04-14T21:43Z (average arrival 2022-04-14T09:34Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 54% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor) (notification 20220412-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at strong levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=7 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 7 occurred during the synoptic period of 2022-04-10T03:00Z-06:00Z (see notification 20220410-AL-002). This strong geomagnetic storm was possibly associated with the combined arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 of a S-type CME first visible by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-07T05:36Z and a coronal hole high speed stream signature.  The CME is possibly associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-04-09T12:46Z (see notification 20220409-AL-001) and the coronal hole high speed stream embedded signature possibly arrived between late on 2022-04-09 and early on 2022-04-10. The solar wind speeds reached maximum values of about 585 km/s on 2022-04-11 and subsided to 460 km/s by the end of the reporting period.  \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was enhanced through the beginning of the reporting period until 2022-04-07 due to a threshold crossing in the previous reporting period at 2022-04-02T20:05Z. These elevated energetic electron flux levels may have been caused by the combined arrival of two CMEs detected at L1 on 2022-03-31 and further enhanced by a coronal hole high speed stream arrival on 2022-04-02. Towards the end of this reporting period, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu at 2022-04-12T13:10Z (see notifications 20220412-AL-002 and 20220412-AL-003). This electron flux enhancement was caused by the above mentioned arrival around 2022-04-09 of the S-type CME/high speed stream combination described above.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement at the beginning and the end of the reporting period described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-04-11T06:00Z     ~553            C                 2/-6                46                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-04-06T20:54Z     ~520            C               148/27                52                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-09T12:09Z     ~772            C              -144/26                29                          STEREO A, SOHO     \n2022-04-10T03:23Z     ~527            C             NONE/3(POS)             20                          STEREO A, SOHO                \n2022-04-10T09:24Z     ~552            C              -136/25                12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-10T14:53Z     ~808            C              -138/22                22                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-04-11T20:23Z     ~732            C              -166/5                 44                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-04-13T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-04-19T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels throughout the outlook period.  Currently, there are three numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk, 12988 (N16E26), 12989 (N19E62) and 12990 (N16E50) that have remained mostly quiet. Active Regions 12987 and 12985 have decayed to a plage. An unnumbered Active Region is currently rotating onto the Earth-facing disk (near latitude S15) and there are several Active Regions on or just behind the East limb in STEREO A imagery (near latitude S13 and N28, respectively).  These are expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk around 2022-04-16, possibly causing some activity in the second half of the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES has remained significantly elevated due to the previously mentioned combined arrival of the S-type CME and the coronal hole high speed stream. We are now expecting the predicted arrival at L1 on 2022-04-14 of the C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-11T06:00Z. Additional enhancements to geomagnetic activity may be expected from a coronal hole high speed stream that crossed the Earth-facing central meridian on 2022-04-12. This coronal hole might reach geoeffective longitudes around 2022-04-15.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20220413-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/19755/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-04-13T12:07Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-04-13T12:07:17Z\n## Message ID: 20220413-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A and STEREO B. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2022-04-13T22:39Z and 2022-04-14T17:30Z (average arrival 2022-04-14T07:23Z) for 95% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2022-04-14T02:46Z and 2022-04-14T18:11Z (average arrival 2022-04-14T10:27Z) for 89% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-04-13T23:22Z and 2022-04-14T21:43Z (average arrival 2022-04-14T09:34Z) for 100% of simulations.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate to high levels during this reporting period with 1 X-class flare, 4 M-class flares, 2 O-type CMEs, and 6 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the combined leading edge of the C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-03T17:00Z and the C-type CME detected by STEREO A COR2 at 2022-04-03T16:38Z will reach STEREO B at 2022-04-06T07:39Z with the front of the 2022-04-03T16:38Z CME reaching NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-04-06T09:44Z (plus minus 7 hours).  The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 3-5 (below minor to minor).  Additionally, an ensemble simulation of the CME first seen at 2022-04-03T16:38Z with 48 ensemble members estimated that the leading edge of the CME may impact STEREO B between about 2022-04-05T23:46Z and 2022-04-06T14:33Z (average arrival 2022-04-06T07:36Z) for 100% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-04-05T23:52Z and 2022-04-06T16:28Z (average arrival 2022-04-06T07:17Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 75% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor) (see notifications 20220404-AL-003 and 20220406-AL-001).\n\nIt was also estimated that the C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 on 2022-04-04T11:00Z may impact OSIRIS-REx at 2022-04-07T18:45Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2022-04-06T03:10Z, Solar Orbiter at 2022-04-05T06:44Z, and Mars as a glancing blow at 2022-04-08T04:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220404-AL-001).  \n\nFurthermore, it was estimated that the C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-04T11:36Z may affect STEREO A at 2022-04-07T21:17Z and NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-04-08T06:00Z (plus minus 7 hours).  The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 2-3 (below minor). Additionally, an ensemble simulation with 24 ensemble members indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO A between about 2022-04-07T13:32Z and 2022-04-08T12:09Z (average arrival 2022-04-08T02:07Z) for 100% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-04-07T18:14Z and 2022-04-08T09:15Z (average arrival 2022-04-08T00:23Z) for 12% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 88% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 2-4 range (below minor to below minor) (see notifications 20220405-AL-001 and 20220406-AL-002).\n\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-03-31T00:00Z-06:00Z and 2022-04-02T03:00Z-06:00Z. The elevated values of Kp on 2022-03-31 were caused by the combined arrival of the 2022-03-28 CMEs at L1, associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-03-31T01:41Z and a magnetopause crossing at 2022-03-31T04:10Z (see notifications 20220331-AL-003, 20220331-AL-001, and 20220331-AL-005). The elevated value of Kp on 2022-04-02 was caused by the arrival of a weak coronal hole high speed stream that detected at L1 on 2022-04-02.\n\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu beginning at 2022-04-02T20:05Z (see notifications 20220402-AL-006, 20220402-AL-007, and 20220404-AL-002).  The elevated energetic electron flux levels may be caused by the influence of the combined arrival of the 2022-03-28 CMEs on 2022-03-31 and further enhanced by a coronal hole high speed stream which arrived on 2022-04-02.\n\n\nTwo solar energetic particle events were detected during the reporting period.  The first solar energetic particle event was detected by STEREO A, GOES, and SOHO.  At STEREO A, the flux of 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2022-03-30T18:24Z (see notifications 20220330-AL-004 and 20220330-AL-005).  At GOES, the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2022-03-31T06:20Z.  At SOHO, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2022-03-31T04:33Z (see notifications 20220331-AL-002 and 20220331-AL-004).  This solar energetic particle event was due to the X1.3 class flare from Active Region 12975 that peaked at 2022-03-30T17:37Z and the associated C-type CME first detected by STEREO A COR2 at 2022-03-30T18:23Z, possibly further enhanced by the combined arrival at L1 of C-type CMEs first seen at 2022-03-28T12:09Z (in SOHO LASCO C2) and 2022-03-28T20:23Z (in STEREO A COR2). \n\nThe second solar energetic particle event was detected by GOES and SOHO.  At GOES, the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2022-04-02T14:30Z (see notifications 20220402-AL-002 and 20220402-AL-003).

This solar energetic particle event was due to the M3.9 class flare from Active Region 12976 that peaked at 2022-04-02T13:55Z and the associated O-type CME first detected by STEREO A COR2 at 2022-04-02T13:38Z.\n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the solar energetic particle events and the radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-03-30  17:21:00  17:46:00  17:37:00   X1.3   N13W34 ( 12975 ) \n2022-03-31  18:23:00  18:45:00  18:35:00   M9.6   N13W48 ( 12975 ) \n2022-04-02  02:39:00  03:07:00  02:56:00   M2.9   N13W67 ( 12975 ) \n2022-04-02  12:56:00  14:44:00  13:55:00   M3.9   N15W61 ( 12976 ) \n2022-04-02  17:34:00  17:51:00  17:44:00   M4.3   N13W75 ( 12975 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-03-30T18:23Z     ~808            C                15/0                 40                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-03-31T19:09Z     ~576            C                48/-3                35                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-04-02T13:38Z     ~1370           O                54/-15               45                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-04-03T16:38Z     ~702            C                22/-4                35                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-04-04T11:36Z     ~526            C               -44/20                41                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-03-30T06:24Z     ~1048           O              -175/19                52                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-03T17:00Z     ~767            C                58/31                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-04T11:00Z     ~777            C               110/-24               33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-04-06T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-04-12T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels throughout the outlook period.  Currently, there are five numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk and several more unnumbered Active Regions that have rotated onto the disk recently.  Active Regions 12978 (S17W47) and 12981 (S25W45) have been the sources of lower C-class flaring and may produce some flaring activity as they rotate towards the western limb of the Earth-facing disk.  Active Region 12986 (N15W60) has remained quiet and will soon rotate off the Earth-facing disk, while Active Regions 12985 (S20E32) and 12983 (N24W06) might show some lower level flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Also, some possible activity from the backside of the Sun may be expected due to the rotation of Active Region 12975 which was the responsible of many flares and CMEs during this reporting period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period due to the possible arrival on 2022-04-06 of the C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-03T17:00Z, as well as the anticipated arrival on 2022-04-08 of the C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-04T11:36Z as described above. Additional enhancements to geomagnetic activity may be expected from a coronal hole high speed stream currently centered near S25W00.  This coronal hole is expected to reach a geoeffective longitudes around 2022-04-11.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20220406-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/19688/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-04-06T18:15Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-04-06T18:15:13Z\n## Message ID: 20220406-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B and Mars. For 36 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO B between about 2022-04-04T03:53Z and 2022-04-04T20:32Z (average arrival 2022-04-04T11:53Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2022-04-04T23:09Z and 2022-04-05T16:02Z (average arrival 2022-04-05T06:18Z) for 97% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-04-04T02:57Z and 2022-04-04T22:37Z (average arrival 2022-04-04T13:06Z) for 52% of simulations.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO B between about 2022-04-03T19:41Z and 2022-04-04T12:48Z (average arrival 2022-04-04T03:56Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-04-03T15:53Z and 2022-04-03T22:36Z (average arrival 2022-04-03T19:25Z) for 14% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 100% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 2-4 range (below minor to below minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX121/20220331_190900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX121_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX121/20220331_190900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX121_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX121/20220331_190900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX121_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX121/20220331_190900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX121_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX121/20220331_190900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX121_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-04-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX121/20220331_190900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX121_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\n\nThe initial non-ensemble simulation also included glancing blows at Mars and OSIRIS-REx (see notification 20220401-AL-002).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set.
