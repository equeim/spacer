There are some active regions present on the solar surface that might generate some activity.  On 2020-04-29, active region 12761 had an eruption around 05:30UT as seen on the SDO imagery.  There was a CME associated with this eruption, visible around 07:54UT from STEREO A coronagraph. This CME is currently being measured.   Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week due to a possible disturbance from an S-type (<500 km/s) CME that was first visible on 2020-04-27T13:54Z from STEREO A coronagraph and a possible impact from the CME mentioned above.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

The CME was first seen on the STEREO A coronagraph around 2020-04-14T21:54Z.  The CME arrival was then followed by a coronal hole high speed stream around 2020-04-21.

Solar wind speed reached values of >530 km/s on 2020-03-31.   \n\nThe >2 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was above the threshold of 10^3 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period until 2020-03-26T12:25Z.  These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were elevated due to a possible combination of several small coronal holes high speed stream arrivals detected by ACE at L1 on 2020-03-21 and 2020-03-23, respectively (see notification 20200325-7D-001).  They remained below the threshold of 10^3 pfu for the rest of the reporting period.  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the significantly elevated electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-04-01T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-04-07T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.  There is only one active region as seen on the available imagery and it has low magnetic complexity.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week due to a possible arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream around 2020-04-05.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s  \nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
