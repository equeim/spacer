There were 5 C-type CMEs (see details below). Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the combined front of two C-type CMEs (first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-07-23T21:36Z and 2021-07-24T00:36Z) would impact Solar Orbiter at 2021-07-26T20:40Z, STEREO A at 2021-07-27T02:20Z, and give a glancing blow at NASA missions Earth at 2021-07-27T08:00Z (+- 7 hours) (see notification 20210724-AL-001).\n\nIn addition, a heliospheric ensemble model was carried out for the 2021-07-24T00:36Z CME. For 48 ensemble members, simulations indicated that the leading edge of the CME would reach STEREO A between about 2021-07-26T17:46Z and 2021-07-27T05:11Z (average arrival 2021-07-27T00:02Z) for 100% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-07-26T20:04Z and 2021-07-26T21:13Z (average arrival 2021-07-26T20:38Z) for 4% of simulations (see notification 20210725-AL-001).\n\nBased on a heliospheric model carried out for the combined front of two CMEs (first, C-type, CME visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-07-26T16:48Z and an S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-07-27T03:24Z), it was estimated that the leading edge would reach NASA missions near Earth at 2021-07-30T03:10Z (+- 7 hours) (see notifications 20210726-AL-001 and 20210728-AL-003). Additionally, an ensemble model was carried out for the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-07-26T16:48Z. The leading edge is estimated to reach STEREO A between about 2021-07-29T19:05Z and 2021-07-30T03:42Z (average arrival 2021-07-30T00:10Z) for 12% of simulations and at NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-07-29T15:32Z and 2021-07-30T08:38Z (average arrival 2021-07-29T23:17Z) for 68% of simulations (see notification 20210728-AL-002).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic period 2021-07-22T06:00Z to 2021-07-22T09:00Z. This slightly elevated value of Kp was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-07-19. \n\nA significant interplanetary shock was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2021-07-27T16:57Z (see notification 20210728-AL-001). The shock is associated with a coronal hole high speed stream arrival on 2021-07-28.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-07-23T21:36Z     ~514            C               -78/-8                18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-07-24T00:36Z     ~600            C               -46/-3                39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-07-26T16:48Z     ~531            C               -19/-17               36                          SOHO, STEREO A        \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-07-26T02:48Z     ~545            C               -/11                  10                          SOHO\n2021-07-26T21:12Z     ~554            C               -/10                  33                          SOHO\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-07-28T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-08-03T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary from low to minor levels for the outlook period. 5 numbered active regions are currently on the Earth facing disk, 12846, 12847, 12848, and 12849, with 12848 soon rotating off the Earth facing disk. Active regions 12849 and 12846 have been producing B-class flares. Active region 12849 may have been responsible for C-type CMEs at 2021-07-23T21:36Z and 2021-07-24T00:36Z, and the active region 12847 may have been responsible for the C-type CME at 2021-07-26T16:38Z. This activity might continue during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary from below minor to moderate levels during the outlook period due to the predicted arrivals at L1 of the 2021-07-24T00:36Z CME on 2021-07-27, the 2021-07-26T16:48Z CME on 2021-07-29, and the 2021-07-27T03:24Z CME on 2021-07-30. An equatorial coronal hole structure extending west on the Earth facing disk associated with the interplanetary shock at 2021-07-27T16:57Z and the coronal hole high speed stream arrival on 2021-07-28 is expected to remain geoeffective through the early part of the outlook period.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20210728-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/17412/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-07-28T12:55Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs update (STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-07-28T12:55:51Z\n## Message ID: 20210728-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the R-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-07-15T21:36Z may impact OSIRIS-REx at 2021-07-17T04:19Z, Mars at 2021-07-18T18:45Z and might give Solar Orbiter a glancing blow at 2021-07-17T20:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20210716-AL-001 and 20210718-AL-001). The O-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-07-17T05:24Z was predicted to impact OSIRIS-REx at 2021-07-19T12:15Z, Solar Orbiter at 2021-07-19T04:13Z and Mars at 2021-07-21T12:29Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20210717-AL-001). The C-type CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2021-07-20T16:48Z was predicted to have a minor impact at STEREO A at 2021-07-22T19:00Z and possibly give a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth at about 2021-07-23T17:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 2-4 (below minor) (see notification 20210721-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods 2021-07-14T15:00Z to 2021-07-14T21:00Z. This slightly elevated value of Kp was associated with the arrival of the CME initially observed on 2021-07-10T13:36 detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-07-14(see notification 20210714-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-07-20T16:48Z     ~971            C               -43/26                29                          STEREO A  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-07-14T21:53Z     ~589            C               -90/-2                32                          STEREO A                          \n2021-07-15T21:36Z     ~2069           R              -170/-9                50                          SOHO                              \n2021-07-15T22:00Z     ~768            C              -160/-43               16                          SOHO                              \n2021-07-17T05:24Z     ~1029           O              -135/1                 47                          SOHO                              \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-07-21T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-07-27T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period. Six numbered Active Regions are currently on the Earth-facing disk, 12842, 12844, 12845, 12846, 12847 and 12848, with 12842 and 12845 soon rotating off the Earth-facing disk. Several more unnumbered Active Regions currently on the STEREO A facing disk are expected to cross onto the Earth-facing disk during the outlook period. One of these Active Regions may have produced the non-Earth-directed R- and O-type CMEs on 2021-07-15 and 2021-07-17, respectively, while located behind the East limb in STEREO A. On 2021-07-20 the Active Region 12846 produced a C-type CME. This activity might continue during the outlook period.\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels for the upcoming week due to the predicted glancing blow at L1 on 2021-07-23 of the CME initially observed by STEREO A on 2021-07-20. A small southern extension of the north polar coronal hole at the center meridian in STEREO A on 2021-07-21 may possibly affect STEREO-A early around 2021-07-24 and may potentially become geoeffective late in the outlook period. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20210721-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/17348/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-07-21T18:30Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-07-21T18:30:29Z\n## Message ID: 20210721-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were 6 C-type CMEs (see details below). Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME starting at 2021-07-10T17:38Z may impact OSIRIS-REx at 2021-07-13T14:05Z and Mars as a glancing blow at 2021-07-16T08:00Z.  It was also estimated that the CME starting at 2021-07-12T06:36Z may have a glancing blow both at OSIRIS-REx and Mars on 2021-07-15T00:00Z and 2021-07-17T16:00Z, respectively. Finally, the CME that started on 2021-07-13T18:53Z was estimated to have an impact at OSIRIS-REx at 2021-07-16T18:33Z (see notification 20210714-AL-002).

An unnumbered Active Region which rotated onto the STEREO A facing disk around 2021-07-06 is expected to cross onto the Earth-facing disk around 2021-07-10. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A small equatorial coronal hole structure at central meridian on 2021-07-07 might become geoeffective around 2021-07-11, and a large northern extension of the southern polar coronal hole nearing the central meridian in SDO is expected to become geoeffective at the end of the outlook period. \n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"FLR","messageID":"20210703-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/17203/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-07-03T14:43Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - X1.5 Flare\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-07-03T14:43:02Z\n## Message ID: 20210703-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
