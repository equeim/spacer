There were no significant flares or CMEs. \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2018-03-23T00:00Z-03:00Z, 2018-03-23T18:00Z-24:00Z, 2018-03-25T00:00Z-06:00Z and 2018-03-25T21:00Z-24:00Z. This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-03-22. The solar wind speed reached values of ~550 km/s on 2018-03-27.  \n\nSTEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2018-03-25. Solar wind speed reached values of ~650 km/s on 2018-03-27.\n\nThe >0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2018-03-21T14:10Z.  These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACR at L1 around 2018-03-14 (see notification 20180321-AL-001). Later on, the threshold level of 10^5 pfu was crossed again starting at 2018-03-26T17:15Z and continued to be elevated for the rest of the reporting period. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes were then associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above that started on 2018-03-22 (see notifications 20180326-AL-001 and 20180326-AL-002). \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\n\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2018-03-28T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2018-04-03T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week. There is only one active region currently visible at the surface of the sun that could produce some flare or CME activity. Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week due to the expected arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2018-03-29.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There is only one active region currently visible at the surface of the sun that could produce some flare or CME activity.  A slight increase in geomagnetic activity may occur due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2018-03-08 followed possibly by the arrival of the flank impact of the CME mentioned above.  \n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
