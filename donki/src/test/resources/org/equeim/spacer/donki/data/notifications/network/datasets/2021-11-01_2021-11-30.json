The elevated energetic electron flux levels were associated to a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2021-11-20.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-11-18T13:48Z     ~551            C               127/2                 38                          SOHO                              \n2021-11-20T06:12Z     ~894            C              -114/7                 10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-11-21T22:12Z     ~515            C                90/13                27                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-11-24T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-11-30T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels for the upcoming week. There are currently three numbered Active Regions (12896, 12897, and 12898) on the Earth-facing disk, all of which have been quiet with minimal flaring activity throughout the reporting period. It is likely they will remain quiet throughout the outlook period as regions 12896 and 12897 rotate off of the Earth-facing disk by the end of the period. There are new regions emerging in the southern hemisphere of the Earth-facing disk that have not been numbered yet, but may become numbered Active Regions during the reporting period. There are at least two Active Regions on the western limb of the STEREO A facing disk near S30 and N20 that may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2021-11-27.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week, but may become slightly elevated due to a small coronal hole centered around S10W10 on 2021-11-24 that may reach a geoeffective longitude starting late on 2021-11-27. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20211124-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/18365/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-11-24T17:21Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, STEREO B, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-11-24T17:21:45Z\n## Message ID: 20211124-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low levels during this reporting period. There were no significant flares and only two C-type CMEs (see details below). Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-11-10T15:16Z was estimated to impact Mars at 2021-11-15T15:45Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2021-11-14T17:01Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20211110-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest level of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods from 2021-11-15T18:00Z to 2021-11-16T06:00Z. This elevated value of Kp was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-11-15 (see notification 20211115-AL-002). The solar wind speed reached values of 600 km/s by 2021-11-16 and has remained elevated.  The arrival of this coronal hole high speed stream was also previously detected by the IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments at STEREO A on 2021-11-14. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu on 2021-11-13 (see notifications 20211113-AL-001, 20211113-AL-002, and 20211115-AL-001). This elevated energetic electron flux is likely due to the arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-11-09, which reached a maximum speed of approximately 468 km/s. However, the energetic electron fluxes were elevated prior to this observed threshold crossing due to the combined arrival of several CMEs at L1 (see notification 20211110-7D-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-11-10T15:16Z     ~951            C               146/-26               32                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2021-11-15T12:00Z     ~512            C               NONE/-13(POS)         29                          SOHO\n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-11-17T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-11-23T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the upcoming week. There are currently four numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing solar disk and all regions exhibit low magnetic complexity and may not produce too much activity in the upcoming period.  Active Regions 12894 and 12895 will rotate off of the Earth-facing disk during the first half of the outlook period. Near the end of the outlook period, Active Regions 12896 and 12897 may reach longitudes that are favorable for magnetic connectivity with Earth. One unnumbered Active Region rotated onto the STEREO A-facing disk (near latitude S25) around 2021-11-15 and may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk early in the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels during the outlook period. Currently, NASA missions near Earth are under the influence of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-11-15 described above. Later on, a small coronal hole centered near S25E25 in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA may reach geoeffective longitudes on or around 2021-11-21. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20211115-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/18306/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-11-15T18:21Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-11-15T18:21:27Z\n## Message ID: 20211115-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The long-duration M2.0 class flare peaking at 2021-11-09T17:02Z possibly originated from Active Region 12891 (near N16W100 at the time of the flare) and was associated with the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2021-11-09T16:48Z (details below).  Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the flank of the CME may give a glancing blow to Mars at 2021-11-13T16:00Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2021-11-13T00:30Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20211109-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at strong levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 7 for the reporting period.

These elevated values of Kp were associated with the possible combined arrival of the C-type CME first detected by STEREO A COR2 at 2021-11-01T18:38Z, C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-11-01T21:36Z, and the O-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-11-02T02:48Z (see notification 20211103-AL-001) detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2021-11-03T19:23Z. Strong compression of the magnetosphere was detected following this arrival.  Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2021-11-03T21:29Z (see notifications 20211103-AL-003 and 20211103-AL-005).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu beginning at 2021-11-04T10:50Z and remained elevated through the remainder of the reporting period (see notifications 20211104-AL-003, 20211104-AL-004, 20211106-AL-001, and 20211108-AL-001).  The elevated energetic electron flux levels were caused by the possible combined arrival of the CMEs mentioned above (see notification 20211103-AL-001).\n\nThe flux of > 10 MeV protons detected by GOES exceeded the 10 pfu threshold starting at 2021-11-03T20:55Z (see notifications 20211103-AL-002 and 20211103-AL-004).  Also, the flux of one or more of the > 15.8 MeV protons channels detected by SOHO were elevated, briefly exceeding the 10^(-1) pfu/MeV threshold, starting at 2021-11-03T20:17Z.  This solar energetic particle event was associated with the possible combined arrival of the CMEs mentioned above (see notification 20211103-AL-001).\n\nThe flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected by STEREO A remained elevated above background levels, but below the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV during the reporting period.  This elevated energetic proton flux level at STEREO A was caused by the C-type CME first seen by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-11-01T02:00Z (see notifications 20211101-AL-001 and 20211101-AL-002).\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the solar energetic particle events and radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2021-11-09  15:47:00  17:37:00  17:02:00   M2.0   N16W100 (12891)\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-11-03T21:48Z     ~590            C                90/-16               45                          SOHO                              \n2021-11-09T16:48Z     ~1310           O               115/4                 45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-11-09T19:12Z     ~733            C               100/2                 37                          SOHO, STEREO A\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-11-10T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-11-16T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at minor levels for the upcoming week.  There are currently three Active Regions on the Earth-facing solar disk.  Active Regions 12893 (N16W47) and 12894 (S30E14) have a low magnetic complexity classification and may not produce too much activity as Active Region 12893 rotates off of the Earth-facing disk by 2021-11-13.  However, Active Region 12895 (N24E36) has been active during the reporting period resulting in two C-class flares.  It may be expected for this Active Region to continue producing some activity throughout the outlook period. Active Region 12891 (near N16W105 at the end of the reporting period), which produced the recent M2.0 class flare and associated O-type CME, may continue to produce more CME activity beyond the western limb of the Earth-facing disk.  One new Active Region rotated onto the STEREO A-facing disk (near latitude S20) on 2021-11-08, and may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk early in the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor levels during the outlook period.  It may become slightly elevated around 2021-11-14 due to a small diffuse coronal hole seen around S30W25 on 2021-11-10.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20211110-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/18282/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-11-10T20:54Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Mars, OSIRIS-REx)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-11-10T20:54:40Z\n## Message ID: 20211110-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate to high levels during this reporting period with 1 X-class flare and 6 M-class flares (see list below).  There were 2 O-type CMEs and 5 C-type CMEs (see details below). The X1.0 class flare peaking at 2021-10-28T15:35Z originated from Active Region 12887 and was associated with the halo O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2021-10-28T15:53Z (details below). \n\nThe arrival of this CME (see notifications 20211028-AL-010, 20211029-AL-001, and 20211029-AL-002 for simulation prediction results) was associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-10-31T09:13Z (see notification 20211031-AL-001). It was also detected by the IMPACT instrument at STEREO A around 2021-10-31T10:00Z.\n\nThe second halo O-type CME was first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2021-11-02T02:48Z and was associated with a long duration M1.6 class flare peaking at 2021-11-02T02:51Z. The O-type CME was simulated with two C-type CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-11-01T18:38Z (associated with a C1.3 flare which peaked at 2021-11-01T18:01Z) and 2021-11-01T21:36Z (associated with a C4.0 flare which peaked at 2021-11-01T21:33Z). It is estimated that the combined leading edge of these CMEs will reach Parker Solar Probe at 2021-11-03T06:39Z, Solar Orbiter at 2021-11-03T16:14Z, STEREO A at 2021-11-04T02:08Z, and STEREO B at 2021-11-04T00:56Z (plus minus 7 hours). The simulation also indicates that the combined leading edge of the CMEs will reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2021-11-03T21:39Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20211102-AL-001 and 20211102-AL-002).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2021-10-31T12:00Z-15:00Z. These elevated values of Kp were associated with the arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2021-10-31T09:13Z of the O-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-10-28T15:53Z described above. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected by STEREO A exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2021-10-28T16:16Z (see notifications 20211028-AL-003 and 20211028-AL-006). Also, the flux of > 100 MeV protons detected by GOES exceeded 1 pfu starting at 2021-10-28T16:35Z (see notifications 20211028-AL-004, 20211028-AL-005, and 20211028-AL-007) followed by the > 10 MeV protons exceeding the 10 pfu threshold starting at 2021-10-28T17:40Z (see notifications 20211028-AL-008 and 20211028-AL-009). The flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels detected by SOHO were also elevated exceeding the 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2021-10-28T17:39Z. This solar energetic particle event was due to the X1.0 flare from Active Region 12887 that peaked at 2021-10-28T15:35Z and the associated O-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-10-28T15:53Z (see notification 20211028-AL-001, 20211028-AL-002, 20211028-AL-010, 20211029-AL-001, and 20211029-AL-002).\n\nThere was a second solar energetic particle event detected by STEREO A. The flux of 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2021-11-01T03:12Z (see notifications 20211101-AL-001 and 20211101-AL-002). This solar energetic particle event was associated with the M1.5 class flare from Active Region 12887 that peaked at 2021-11-01T01:45Z and the associated C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-11-01T02:00Z.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the solar energetic particle events described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2021-10-28  07:34:00  07:45:00  07:40:00   M1.4   S32E02 ( 12887 ) \n2021-10-28  10:19:00  10:37:00  10:28:00   M2.2   S32E02 ( 12887 ) \n2021-10-28  15:17:00  15:48:00  15:35:00   X1.0   S26W04 ( 12887 ) \n2021-10-29  02:22:00  02:53:00  02:42:00   M1.5   N16E53 ( 12891 ) \n2021-11-01  00:57:00  02:10:00  01:45:00   M1.5   S28W48 ( 12887 ) \n2021-11-02  02:03:00  02:57:00  02:51:00   M1.6   N20E03 ( 12891 ) \n2021-11-02  02:57:00  03:05:00  03:01:00   M1.7   S27W66 ( 12887 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-10-28T15:53Z     ~1109           O                 0/-17               49                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2021-11-01T18:38Z     ~509            C                32/-30               32                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2021-11-01T02:00Z     ~657            C                48/-25               47                          SOHO, STEREO A                \n2021-11-01T21:36Z     ~771            C                43/-19               49                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-11-02T02:48Z     ~1151           O                -5/16                51                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-10-29T15:23Z     ~554            C              NONE/-29(POS)          13                          STEREO A                    \n2021-10-29T19:24Z     ~966            C                98/-40               18                          SOHO, STEREO A                        \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-11-03T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-11-09T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels for the upcoming week.  There are currently six Active Regions on the Earth-facing solar disk.  Active Regions 12888 (S13W64), 12889 (S24W58), and 12892 (N26W66) have a low magnetic complexity classification and may not produce too much activity as they rotate off of the Earth-facing disk by 2021-11-06.  However, Active Region 12887 was very active during the reporting period resulting in an X-class flare, four M-class flares, one O-type CME, and the two SEP events mentioned above. It may be expected for this Active Region to produce more activity as it rotates off the Earth-facing disk early in the outlook period. Active Region 12891 (N16W24) which produced the recent M1.6 class flare and associated O-type CME may continue to produce more activity as it continues to rotate towards the limb of the Earth-facing disk throughout the outlook period. Active Region 12893 (N16e32) may continue its heightened activity throughout the outlook period.   Two new Active Regions rotated onto the STEREO A-facing disk at the end of the reporting period, and may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk near the middle of the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be between minor to moderate levels during the outlook period due to the anticipated combined arrival of the halo O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2021-11-02T02:48Z (associated with a long duration M1.6 class flare which peaked at 2021-11-02T02:51Z) and two C-type CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-11-01T18:38Z (associated with a C1.3 class flare which peaked at 2021-11-01T18:01Z) and 2021-11-01T21:36Z (associated with a C4.0 class flare which peaked at 2021-11-01T21:33Z) to NASA missions near Earth at about 2021-11-03T21:39Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20211102-AL-001 and 20211102-AL-002). There is an ongoing interplanetary shock arrival detected at L1 at 2021-11-03T19:23Z that may be associated with the combined arrival of these CMEs (see notification 20211103-AL-001). The event is still ongoing at the time this report was finished.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"SEP","messageID":"20211103-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/18192/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-11-03T21:11Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Auto-generated Space Weather Notification - SEP\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-11-03T21:11:21Z\n## Message ID: 20211103-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
