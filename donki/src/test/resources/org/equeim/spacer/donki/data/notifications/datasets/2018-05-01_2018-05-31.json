This slight increase of geomagnetic activity was associated with a small coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-05-16.  Solar wind speed reached values of >450 km/s on 2018-05-18.  Another coronal hole high speed stream was detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-04-22.  Currently, solar wind speed has reached values around >500 km/s.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt were elevated close to the threshold level of 10^5 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period on 2018-05-16.  This was a continuation of the radiation belt enhancement that started on 2018-05-06T17:10Z.  This elevation of the energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-05-05.  On 2018-05-17, the fluxes decreased and had remained to nominal levels for the rest of the reporting period.   \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low for this reporting period.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2018-05-23T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2018-05-29T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low to moderate levels during this reporting period.  There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).  Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center, it was estimated that this CME (starting at 2018-05-03T17:24Z) may impact Spitzer (glancing blow) and STEREO A (glancing blow).  The flank of the CME was estimated to reach Spitzer at around 2018-05-06T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20180504-AL-001) .  The CME arrival was detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments around 2018-05-07T10:00Z.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=6 occurred during the synoptic period of 2018-05-06T00:00Z to 2018-05-06T03:00Z (see notifications 20180506-AL-001 and 20180506-AL-002).  This moderate increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-05-05.  Solar wind speed reached values of >700 km/s starting on 2018-05-06.  Due to this activity, strong compression of the magnetosphere was detected by simulations carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center. Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2018-05-05T14:33Z (see notification 20180505-AL-001).  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2018-05-06T17:10Z and has remained elevated for the rest of the reporting period.  These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the high speed stream described above (see notifications 20180506-AL-003, 20180506-AL-004, and 20180508-AL-001). \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2018-05-03T17:24Z     ~635            C              -155/1                 33                          STEREO A                          \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2018-05-09T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2018-05-15T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  There are several active regions present at the solar surface that can produce flare and CME activity.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to stay elevated at the beginning of the reporting period due to the high speed stream described above.  Currently, the energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt are still elevated above the threshold of 10^5 pfu and the solar wind speed detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 is still ~600 km/s. \n \n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There are several small active regions currently visible at the solar surface that could produce some flare or CME activity.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week due to the expected arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2018-05-06.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
