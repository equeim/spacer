Source is uncertain, with what could be an on-disk source that does not line up well when used in measurement. Observed well as field line movement over the SE limb in SDO AIA 171/193/211 starting around 2024-05-14T04:06Z. Additionally, a smaller C6.5 flare which peaked at 2024-05-14T04:08Z observed in SDO AIA 131 (this flare does not rise high above background flux, but is distinct in EUV imagery) lines up with this timestamp and the field line movement, but the source coordinates did not work well in swpc_cat triangulation to support it. It is possible that the source for this CME is on/just beyond the SE limb, supported by better triangulation at those longitudes.","submissionTime":"2024-05-14T19:43Z","versionId":1,"link":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CME/30860/-1","cmeAnalyses":[{"isMostAccurate":true,"time21_5":"2024-05-14T11:14Z","latitude":-24.0,"longitude":-90.0,"halfAngle":38.0,"speed":567.0,"type":"C","featureCode":"LE","imageType":"running difference","measurementTechnique":"SWPC_CAT","note":"Measurement at E90, not as plane of sky, but for good triangulation between SOHO and STEREO coronagraphs.
