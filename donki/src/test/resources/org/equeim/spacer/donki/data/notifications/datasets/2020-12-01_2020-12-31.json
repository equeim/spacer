There were no significant flares or CMEs. \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic period of 2020-12-23T03:00Z-06:00Z. This slight increase in geomagnetic activity corresponds to a continued enhancement in the solar wind speed following the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 on 2020-12-21.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2020-12-24T14:05Z and stayed elevated above background levels for the remainder of the reporting period (see notifications 20201224-AL-001, 20201224-AL-002, and 20201226-AL-001). These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 on 2020-12-21.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate during the reporting period due to the radiation belt enhancement mentioned above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-12-30T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-01-05T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low levels during the reporting period.  There was one C-type CME (see details below). The CME event is likely associated with a B1.4 flare (peak time at 2020-12-13T08:55Z) from AR12793 located at S18E90. Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling, it was estimated that this CME may reach Parker Solar Probe at 2020-12-15T15:03Z (plus minus 7 hours)(see notification 20201216-AL-001). The analysis for this event was delayed due to the lack of coronagraph imagery available during the day of occurrence. \n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic period of 2020-12-10T00:00Z-03:00Z. This Kp value is associated with the combined arrivals, detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1, of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2020-12-09 and the arrival of an interplanetary shock at 2020-12-10T01:29Z. The interplanetary shock is likely associated with the CME first seen in the coronagraphs around 2020-12-07T16:24Z (see notifications 20201207-AL-001, 20201207-AL-002, 20201208-AL-001, and 20201210-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low during the reporting period.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2020-12-13T09:24Z     ~610            C              -121/3                 26                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-12-16T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-12-22T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Currently, there are two numbered active regions with low magnetic complexity visible on the Earth-facing disk as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at low levels during the outlook period. A large coronal hole structure extends from the north pole coronal hole of the STEREO-A-facing disk and could become geoeffective towards the end of the outlook period. A large, diffuse coronal hole structure can be seen across the central Earth-facing disk and could result in intermittent to sustained coronal hole high speed streams during the outlook period. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate levels during the reporting period. There was 1 O-type CME (see details below). This O-type CME was first observed by STEREO A COR2 at 2020-12-07T16:24Z and is associated with a C7.4 flare from active region 12790 which peaked at 2020-12-07T16:32Z (see notification 20201207-AL-001). Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling, it was estimated that this CME may reach Mars at 2020-12-10T09:43Z (plus minus 7 hours) and is expected to impact NASA missions near Earth. The leading edge of the CME was predicted to reach NASA missions near Earth around 2020-12-09T05:23Z (plus minus 7 hours), with the roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index of 5-8 (minor to severe) (see notification 20201207-AL-002).\n\nBased on additional heliospheric ensemble modeling the CME is expected to impact Mars and missions near Earth. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicated that the leading edge of the CME would reach Mars between about 2020-12-09T21:38Z and 2020-12-10T20:32Z (average arrival 2020-12-10T06:38Z) for 100% of simulations, and NASA missions near Earth between about 2020-12-09T00:55Z and 2020-12-09T14:45Z (average arrival 2020-12-09T06:54Z) for 100% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 76% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 5-7 range (minor to strong) (see notification 20201208-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=2 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period (see notifications 20201202-AL-002 and 20201202-AL-003) and stayed somewhat elevated for the rest of it. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 on 2020-11-30.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were elevated above background levels at the beginning of the reporting period in response to the M-class flare and O-type CME mentioned in last week's report (see notification 20201202-7D-001). The 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A became elevated above background levels again towards the end of the reporting period in response to the C7.4 flare and O-type CME described above.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement mentioned above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2020-12-07T16:24Z     ~1383           O                12/-21               41                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-12-09T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-12-15T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. There are a few active regions visible on the Earth-facing disk as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and strong levels during the outlook period. A coronal hole structure visible to the west of the center of the Earth-facing disk in SDO AIA 193 in the past few days may become geoeffective within the next few days. Additionally, the anticipated arrival of the 2020-12-07T16:24Z O-type CME at Earth around 2020-12-09 is expected to elevate geomagnetic activity. \n\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate levels during the reporting period with one M-class flare (see list below).  There were two C-type and one O-type CMEs (see details below).  The first C-type CME was associated with an eruption beyond the northeastern limb of the Earth-facing disk and first seen by SOHO C2 at 2020-11-26T21:24Z from active region AR12787 at N32E90.  Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling, it is estimated that this CME may affect Parker Solar Probe around 2020-11-29T14:12Z and a glancing blow to STEREO A around 2020-11-30T18:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20201127-AL-001). The second C-type CME was associated with a filament eruption from active region AR12787 and first seen by SOHO C2 at 2020-12-01T05:48Z.  Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling, it is estimated that this CME may affect Mars around 2020-12-06T07:51Z and STEREO A around 2020-12-03T12:35Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20201201-AL-003 and 20201202-AL-001). The O-type CME was first observed by STEREO A COR2 at 2020-11-29T13:24Z and was associated with a M4.4 flare that peaked at 2020-11-29T13:11Z and an eruption from the active region beyond the southeastern limb estimated at location S23E97 of the Earth-facing disk.  Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling, it is estimated that this CME may affect Mars at 2020-12-02T22:37Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2020-11-30T19:37Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2020-11-30T19:37Z, and STEREO A at 2020-12-01T09:46Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20201129-AL-001, 20201130-AL-004, 20201201-AL-001).  The simulation also indicates that the CME may have a possible glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth.  Simulations indicate that the flank of the CME may reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2020-12-02T02:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). Analysis is still ongoing to determine if this CME was detected at Earth. STEREO A IMPACT instruments detected the arrival of the O-type CME described above around 2020-12-01T07:25Z.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 3 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES were above the threshold level of 1000 pfu during the first half of the reporting period. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt were a continuation of the radiation belt enhancement that started on 2020-11-22T16:40Z and were further enhanced by a coronal hole high speed stream that was detected at L1 around 2020-11-26. Solar wind speeds reached values of 470 km/s on 2020-11-26.\n\nThe flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected by STEREO A initially exceeded 0.1 pfu/MeV starting at 2020-11-30T04:26Z and is associated with the M-class flare and O-type CME mentioned above (see notifications 20201130-AL-001 and 20201130-AL-002). Proton fluxes were further enhanced to higher levels at 2020-11-30T14:16Z and may be associated with the possible arrival of the 2020-11-26T21:24Z CME (see notification 20201130-AL-003). The energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES were below threshold levels for the entire reporting period, but became elevated due to this activity. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the continuing radiation belt enhancement and solar energetic particle events mentioned above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2020-11-29  12:34:00  13:41:00   13:11:00   M4.4   S25E97           \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2020-11-29T13:25Z     ~1336           O               -75/-6                58                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2020-12-01T07:12Z     ~774            C               -45/8                 35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2020-11-26T21:24Z     ~550            C              -100/6                 32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-12-02T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-12-08T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period. Several active regions are visible on the Earth-facing disk as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO. Active regions 12786 and 12790 have been active in the last few days.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period with possible arrivals at Earth of the 2020-11-29T13:25Z O-type CME around 2020-12-02 and the 2020-12-01T07:12Z C-type CME around 2020-12-04. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2020-12-02T14:10Z (see notifications 20201202-AL-002 and 20201202-AL-003) and could remain elevated during the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

Based on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A and Mars. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2020-12-03T16:57Z and 2020-12-04T08:30Z (average arrival 2020-12-04T00:32Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2020-12-05T22:32Z and 2020-12-06T06:31Z (average arrival 2020-12-06T02:44Z) for 14% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2020-12-04T09:32Z and 2020-12-04T18:47Z (average arrival 2020-12-04T13:27Z) for 6% of simulations.
