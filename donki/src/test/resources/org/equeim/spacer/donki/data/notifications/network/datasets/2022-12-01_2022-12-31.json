The CME was estimated to reach NASA Missions near Earth between about 2022-12-26T01:37Z and 2022-12-27T01:03Z (average arrival 2022-12-26T12:03Z) for 54% of simulations. The full results can be found here: https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-12-24_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162/Detailed_results_20221224_054100_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162.txt (see notification 20221225-AL-002). The arrival of this CME may have been detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-12-26T00:33Z and at STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments around 2022-12-26T08:00Z (see notification 20221226-AL-001). This arrival signature is still under analysis.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period 2022-12-26T12:00Z-15:00Z. This elevated value of Kp was likely caused by the arrival of the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-12-24T02:48Z associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-12-26T00:33Z (see notification 20221226-AL-001). In addition, the interplanetary shock may have been associated with a strong compression of the magnetosphere. Simulations carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2022-12-27T04:54Z (see notifications 20221227-AL-001 and 20221227-AL-002).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2022-12-24T14:05Z. The elevated energetic electron flux levels were likely caused by a coronal hole high speed stream which started on 2022-12-22, reaching a maximum sustained speed of approximately 685 km/s (see notifications 20221224-AL-001 and 20221224-AL-002). The energetic electron flux subsided to background levels on 2022-12-26. Later on, the electron flux was elevated and crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu again starting at 2022-12-27T17:05Z. This second elevation may have been associated with the arrival of the aforementioned CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-12-24T02:48Z with additional influence from another coronal hole high speed stream arrival observed on 2022-12-24 and associated with an interplanetary shock observed in DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-12-23T19:21Z (see notification 20221227-AL-003). The solar wind speed is currently around 520 km/s.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-12-27  00:46:00  01:00:00  00:54:00   M2.0   N18E63 ( 13176 ) \n2022-12-27  08:02:00  08:35:00  08:15:00   M1.0   N17E60 ( 13176 ) \n2022-12-27  16:15:00  16:34:00  16:26:00   M1.2   N21W54 ( 13169 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-12-24T02:48Z     ~1055           O               -33/31                27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-24T08:36Z     ~703            C                37/-37               32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-12-21T04:48Z     ~547            C               -41/6                 17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-24T08:00Z     ~543            C              -144/-11               21                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-24T15:14Z     ~924            C                22/-67               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-25T02:00Z     ~656            C              NONE/2                 36                          SOHO\n2022-12-25T07:24Z     ~639            C                37/-34               22                          SOHO                              \n2022-12-25T19:12Z     ~506            C               -85/0                 11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-25T21:49Z     ~906            C               -99/-57               29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-26T00:12Z     ~693            C               -73/0                 17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-26T06:00Z     ~683            C               -85/-5                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-26T13:25Z     ~697            C                70/36                19                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-12-27T08:24Z     ~711            C              NONE/7                 13                          SOHO\n2022-12-27T18:24Z     ~1051           O               117/46                12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-12-28T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-01-03T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently five numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13176 (N19E40) produced 2 M-class flares and Active Region 13169 (N22W70) produced one M-class flare during the reporting period. These Active Regions may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity during the outlook period. At least two unnumbered Active Regions located around latitudes N20 and S20 are expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO and STEREO A.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels throughout the outlook period. As seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO, a coronal hole currently centered around N30W15 may reach geoeffective longitudes on or around 2022-12-30. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt is currently elevated near the threshold level of 1000 pfu and may remain elevated through the beginning of the outlook period. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20221227-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/23034/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-12-27T18:20Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-12-27T18:20:56Z\n## Message ID: 20221227-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A, STEREO B, and Mars. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2022-12-25T22:57Z and 2022-12-27T05:03Z (average arrival 2022-12-26T10:32Z) for 75% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2022-12-26T04:52Z and 2022-12-26T21:54Z (average arrival 2022-12-26T13:29Z) for 25% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2022-12-27T10:22Z and 2022-12-28T12:15Z (average arrival 2022-12-27T22:06Z) for 45% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-12-26T01:37Z and 2022-12-27T01:03Z (average arrival 2022-12-26T12:03Z) for 54% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 84% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-12-24_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162/20221224_054100_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-12-24_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162/20221224_054100_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-12-24_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162/20221224_054100_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-12-24_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162/20221224_054100_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-12-24_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162/20221224_054100_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-12-24_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162/20221224_054100_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162_Mars_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-12-24_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162/20221224_054100_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-12-24_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162/20221224_054100_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162_STA_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-12-24_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162/20221224_054100_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-12-24_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162/20221224_054100_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2022-12-24T02:48:00-CME-001) is also predicted to have an impact at Solar Orbiter at 2022-12-26T15:29Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20221224-AL-003).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-12-24_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162/Detailed_results_20221224_054100_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX162.txt\n###\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"MPC","messageID":"20221225-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22978/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-12-25T00:47Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Auto-generated Space Weather Notification - Magnetopause Crossing\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-12-25T00:47:20Z\n## Message ID: 20221225-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic period of 2022-12-19T03:00Z-06:00Z. Analysis is ongoing, but this enhancement of geomagnetic activity may have been associated with the combined arrival of a coronal mass ejection and a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-12-19. An associated interplanetary shock was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-12-18T19:52Z (see notification 20221218-AL-002), as well as a predicted magnetopause crossing to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2022-12-19T07:15Z (see notifications 20221219-AL-001 and 20221219-AL-002). \n\nAdditionally, the STEREO A IMPACT instrument detected an interplanetary shock around 2022-12-18T14:44Z. This arrival may have been associated with the same combined CME and coronal hole high speed stream arrival at L1 mentioned above.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to increased flaring and CME activity (see details below). \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-12-14  07:30:00  07:47:00  07:40:00   M2.4   S20W42

Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-12-21T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-12-27T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between moderate to high levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently six active regions on the Earth-facing disk. Most of the flaring activity (at least 29 of the M-class flares) seen throughout the reporting period originated from Active Region 13165 which rotated off of the Earth-facing disk on 2022-12-18. Additional high flaring activity was seen from Active Region 13169 (N21E32) which produced 4 of the M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to show higher level flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Active Regions 13166 (S08W82), 13163 (S19W70), 13170 (S20E37), and 13171 (N24E48) have produced C-level flaring activity throughout the reporting period and may continue flaring in the next week. The activity was also very high on the farside as seen by the extensive list of CMEs (see list above). This activity can continue for the next several weeks. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor levels throughout the outlook period. There may be enhancements in geomagnetic activity due to small coronal holes seen across the northern hemisphere of the Earth-facing disk. The first of these coronal holes, located near N20W45, may become geoeffective within the next 48 hours. Additional coronal holes are currently centered around N03W03 and N15E20, the former of which may become geoeffective on or around 2022-12-25. Current enhancements in the solar wind parameters appear to be indicative of flux rope signatures, however no candidate CMEs have been found to associate with the signatures due to the limited imagery available at this time. Analysis is still ongoing.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"MPC","messageID":"20221219-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22903/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-12-19T13:23Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Magnetopause Crossing\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-12-19T13:23:56Z\n## Message ID: 20221219-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2022-12-07T12:00Z-15:00Z. This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-12-07. An associated interplanetary shock was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-11-07T08:46Z (see notification 20221207-AL-001). The maximum sustained solar wind speed observed by DSCOVR at L1 reached approximately 600 km/s on 2022-12-08. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was enhanced at the beginning of this reporting period due to a threshold crossing during the previous reporting period beginning at 2022-12-01T14:15Z. This enhancement was caused by a coronal hole high speed stream which arrived on 2022-11-30 (see notifications 20221203-AL-001, 20221205-AL-001, and 20221207-AL-002). The energetic electron flux levels subsided to background levels late on 2022-12-07 and remained at background levels for the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-12-08T05:36Z     ~516            C                90/-45               33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-08T06:48Z     ~1468           O               105/36                19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-08T14:09Z     ~837            C               100/50                10                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-12-08T17:09Z     ~605            C              -112/-16               33                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-12-08T18:12Z     ~1153           O               107/26                10                          SOHO, STEREO A \n2022-12-09T20:00Z     ~734            C            NONE(POS)/24             43                          SOHO\n2022-12-10T02:48Z     ~1090           O            NONE(POS)/0              58                          SOHO     \n2022-12-10T15:12Z     ~714            C               -90/36                25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-10T16:00Z     ~993            C              -153/53                10                          SOHO                              \n2022-12-11T02:00Z     ~557            C               165/13                31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-11T08:12Z     ~1131           O               144/32                16                          SOHO                              \n2022-12-11T10:12Z     ~757            C               -80/45                18                          SOHO                              \n2022-12-11T15:48Z     ~769            C              -168/-26               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-12T01:12Z     ~1297           O               177/0                 45                          SOHO                              \n2022-12-12T02:12Z     ~568            C               170/8                 45                          SOHO\n2022-12-12T05:12Z     ~693            C            NONE(POS)/42             23                          SOHO                              \n2022-12-12T09:12Z     ~819            C              -134/32                20                          SOHO                              \n2022-12-12T14:36Z     ~650            C              -119/47                18                          SOHO, STEREO A   \n2022-12-13T07:00Z     ~662            C            NONE(POS)/41             15                          SOHO                 \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-12-14T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-12-20T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate to high levels for the upcoming reporting period. There are currently 11 numbered active regions on the Earth facing disk.  Active Region 13163 (S20E18) and Active Region 13153 (S15W95), which has rotated off the Earth-facing disk, have produced almost 10 M-class flares on 2022-12-14, some of which are associated with CMEs. These Active Regions may continue to exhibit flaring activity during the outlook period. Additionally, there is an unnumbered Active Region visible on the STEREO A northeastern limb which may rotate onto the Earth facing disk by 2022-12-15. On the backside, the CME activity was high (see list above), and this may continue throughout the upcoming reporting period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be low to minor during the outlook period. There are several coronal holes seen in the SDO imagery. The first one is a southern coronal hole which reached the central meridian on 2022-12-13 and may become geoeffective on or around 2022-12-19. The second one is currently located around N18E45. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"FLR","messageID":"20221214-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22779/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-12-14T15:05Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Auto-generated Space Weather Notification - Flare intensity has crossed the threshold of M5.0\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-12-14T15:05:38Z\n## Message ID: 20221214-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were 3 O-type CMEs and 4 C-type CMEs(see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the CME starting on 2022-12-01T07:48Z may affect Mars at 2022-12-04T22:02Z, Solar Orbiter at 2022-12-03T03:34Z, STEREO A at 2022-12-03T12:42Z, and STEREO B at 2022-12-03T09:37Z (plus minus 7 hours). The simulation also indicated that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-12-03T09:37Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index was 4-6 (below minor to moderate) (see notifications 20221201-AL-001 and 20221201-AL-002). An ensemble with 48 members was also performed and it predicted that the CME would reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-12-03T09:19Z and 2022-12-04T01:11Z (average arrival 2022-12-03T17:17Z) for 12% of simulations.

This CME arrival may have been detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-12-04T12:09Z.  This arrival is still under analysis. \n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs would impact: \n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2022-12-03T18:00Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2022-12-04T22:00Z (see notification 20221203-AL-002)\n2022-12-04T01:25Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2022-12-05T03:00Z (see notification 20221204-AL-001)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-11-30T18:00Z-21:00Z and 2022-12-01T03:00Z-06:00Z.  This slight enhancement of the geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2022-11-30.  The solar wind speed reached maximum values of 700 km/s on 2022-12-02.  \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2022-12-01T14:15Z and has remained elevated for the whole reporting period. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream arrival on 2022-11-30 described above (see notifications 20221203-AL-001 and 20221205-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-12-01  07:04:00  07:36:00  07:21:00   M1.0   N27W35 ( 13152 ) \n2022-12-03  17:36:00  17:45:00  17:41:00   M1.2   N14E80 ( 13157 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-12-01T07:48Z     ~1306           O                17/27                30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-11-30T17:24Z     ~1386           O                90/10                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-01T01:25Z     ~1091           O              -168/24                45                          SOHO                              \n2022-12-02T13:09Z     ~834            C                35/39                10                          STEREO A                          \n2022-12-03T02:12Z     ~540            C               -70/-5                10                          SOHO                              \n2022-12-03T18:00Z     ~508            C               -80/2                 28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-04T01:25Z     ~545            C               -53/-9                16                          SOHO                              \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-12-07T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-12-13T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate. There are seven numbered active regions, but most of them have maintained a low activity profile for the current reporting period. Active region 13157 has been the one responsible for most of the B and C-class flares in the last couple of days and can remain active for the next reporting period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be minor to moderate for the next upcoming period due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-12-07. The energetic electron fluxes at the outer radiation belt are still above the threshold of 1000 pfu (see notification 20221207-AL-002). These elevated fluxes can be further enhanced with the arrival of this coronal hole high speed stream. The solar wind speed values are rising with current values at around 500 km/s and the Kp index has reached Kp=5 during the 2022-12-07T12:00Z-15:00Z synoptic period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20221207-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22664/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-12-07T14:04Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-12-07T14:04:51Z\n## Message ID: 20221207-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-12-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX161/Detailed_results_20221201_074800_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX161.txt\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20221201-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22599/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-12-01T13:39Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-12-01T13:39:36Z\n## Message ID: 20221201-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The most recent crossing of the 1000 pfu threshold was at 2022-11-30T07:05Z and the fluxes are currently elevated but below the threshold.\n\nThe elevated energetic electron flux levels are caused by a coronal hole high speed stream that arrived at L1 on 2022-11-27 (see notification 20221128-AL-001), reaching a maximum sustained speed of approximately 700 km/s. The solar wind observed at L1 is currently around 550 km/s.\n\nNASA spacecraft at GEO, MEO and other orbits passing through or in the vicinity of the Earth's outer radiation belt can be impacted.\n\nActivity ID: 2022-11-29T13:55:00-RBE-001. \n\n## Notes: \n\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20221201-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22598/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-12-01T11:37Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (Mars, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, STEREO B, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-12-01T11:37:13Z\n## Message ID: 20221201-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that this CME may affect Mars, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, and STEREO B.  The leading edge of the CME will reach Mars at 2022-12-04T22:02Z, Solar Orbiter at 2022-12-03T03:34Z, STEREO A at 2022-12-03T12:42Z, and STEREO B at 2022-12-03T09:37Z (plus minus 7 hours). \n\nThe simulation also indicates that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth. Simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-12-03T09:37Z (plus minus 7 hours).
