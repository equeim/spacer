The first value of Kp=4.67 occurred during the synoptic period 2024-09-19T00:00Z-03:00Z. The second value of Kp=4.67 occurred during the synoptic period of 2024-09-24T21:00Z to 2024-09-25T00:00Z and was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2024-09-24, reaching a maximum sustained speed of approximately 550 km/s.\n\nThe >2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2024-09-19T16:50Z (see notifications 20240919-AL-001, 20240919-AL-002, 20240921-AL-001, and 20240923-AL-001). This elevation of energetic electron flux levels was associated with the arrival of the O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-09-14T15:36Z detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-09-16T22:49Z during the previous reporting period. The energetic electron flux levels subsided to background levels on 2024-09-24.\n\nThe energetic proton fluxes at GOES and SOHO remained elevated at the beginning of the reporting period due to a prior solar energetic particle event first detected in the previous reporting period at GOES around 2024-09-17T07:35Z (see notifications 20240917-AL-002 and 20240917-AL-003) and at SOHO around 2024-09-17T04:40Z (see notifications 20240917-AL-004 and 20240917-AL-006). The particle environment at GOES was enhanced but below threshold at the beginning of the reporting period, and decreased to background levels on 2024-09-19. The enhanced particle environment at SOHO decreased below threshold towards background levels on 2024-09-18.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this reporting period due to the persistent effects of solar energetic particle events observed at GOES and SOHO and the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-09-22  21:12:00  22:05:00  21:39:00   M3.7   S23E65 ( 13835 ) \n2024-09-23  14:23:00  15:34:00  14:56:00   M1.3   S12E90 ( 13836 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-09-22T21:36Z     ~1239           O               -25/-41               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed (POS = Plane Of Sky):\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-09-18T05:48Z     ~812            C               153/-45               22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-09-18T06:24Z     ~620            C              -160/-61               32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-09-18T12:36Z     ~640            C               -59/-45               33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-09-18T22:12Z     ~851            C               131/26                12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-09-19T22:00Z     ~531            C         NONE(POS)/41                10                          SOHO                              \n2024-09-21T11:12Z     ~651            C                99/29                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-09-21T20:00Z     ~561            C                80/55                10                          SOHO                              \n2024-09-22T19:12Z     ~537            C                95/35                15                          SOHO                              \n2024-09-23T02:00Z     ~512            C         NONE(POS)/36                15                          SOHO                              \n2024-09-24T04:12Z     ~577            C               -22/-53               20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-09-25T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-10-01T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels in the outlook period. There are currently eight numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13835 (S22E27) and 13836 (S10E48) each produced 1 M-class flare and multiple C-class flares during the reporting period, and may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period due to the anticipated arrival of the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-09-22T21:36Z associated with the M3.7 flare from Active Region 13835 (S23E65) peaking at 2024-09-22T21:39Z. There is a slight chance for minor enhancement in the geomagnetic activity on or around 2024-09-28 due to the possible arrival of the S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-09-23T20:48Z. Geomagnetic activity reached minor levels with Kp=5.00 during the synoptic period 2024-09-25T03:00Z-06:00Z. This increase in geomagnetic activity is associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 on 2024-09-24 mentioned previously in the summary above. A coronal hole currently observed to be crossing the central meridian near S05W00 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-09-29.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20240923-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/33545/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-09-23T17:31Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-09-23T17:31:44Z\n## Message ID: 20240923-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp = 7.67 occurred during the synoptic period 2024-09-17T00:00Z-03:00Z. This enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-09-16T22:49Z which was likely associated with the arrival of the O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-09-14T15:36Z (see notification 20240916-AL-001). This arrival was also detected by STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments around 2024-09-17T03:30Z. Earlier in the reporting period, additional enhancements in geomagnetic activity were observed on 2024-09-12 and 2024-09-13. On 2024-09-12, simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to geosynchronous orbit starting at 2024-09-12T18:40Z (see notifications 20240912-AL-012 and 20240912-AL-013).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2024-09-13T16:35Z (see notifications 20240913-AL-005, 20240913-AL-006, and 20240915-AL-001) and subsided to background levels on 2024-09-17. This elevation of energetic electron flux levels was likely associated with the arrival of the C-type CME first seen in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2024-09-10T00:23Z detected by ACE and DSCOVR at L1 at 2024-09-12T02:53Z (see notification 20240912-AL-006).\n\nA solar energetic particle event was detected by SOHO and GOES during the reporting period. Beginning on 2024-09-14, the particle environments at STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES became elevated above background levels but below their respective thresholds due to the X4.5 flare from Active Region 13825 (S18E55) which peaked at 2024-09-14T15:29Z (see notifications 20240914-AL-004 and 20240914-AL-005). The enhanced particle environment at STEREO A returned to background levels on 2024-09-16. At SOHO, the fluxes of the 15.8-39.8 and 28.2-50.1 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-09-17T04:40Z and 2024-09-17T14:31Z, respectively (see notifications 20240917-AL-004 and 20240917-AL-006). At GOES, the integral flux of the >10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2024-09-17T07:35Z (see notifications 20240917-AL-002 and 20240917-AL-003). This solar energetic particle event was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-09-16T22:49Z which was associated with the arrival of the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-09-14T15:36Z (see notifications 20240914-AL-006, 20240914-AL-007, and 20240915-AL-002). The enhanced particle environment at GOES began to decrease below threshold on 2024-09-17, but remained elevated above background levels through the end of the reporting period. The particle environment at SOHO remained elevated above threshold through the end of the reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this reporting period due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt, the solar energetic particle events detected at SOHO, GOES, and STEREO A, and the enhanced geomagnetic activity described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-09-11  12:27:00  12:47:00

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth. Out of 25 ensemble members (see notes section), 25 (100%) indicate impact at NASA missions near Earth. Ensemble simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-09-16T10:05Z and 2024-09-16T20:27Z (average arrival 2024-09-16T15:32Z). The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 59% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 5-7 range (minor to strong).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-09-14_ncmes1_sims25_LAHAINA070/20240914_153600_ncmes1_sims25_LAHAINA070_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-09-14_ncmes1_sims25_LAHAINA070/20240914_153600_ncmes1_sims25_LAHAINA070_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-09-14_ncmes1_sims25_LAHAINA070/20240914_153600_ncmes1_sims25_LAHAINA070_Earth_stack.gif\n\n\n## Notes:\n\nThis CME event (2024-09-14T15:36:00-CME-001) is also predicted to impact Parker Solar Probe at 2024-09-15T12:01Z, Lucy at 2024-09-16T14:25Z, and STEREO A (minor impact) at 2024-09-17T03:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20240914-AL-007).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME with ID 2024-09-13T10:12:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20240913-AL-007). \n\n### Notification information (STEREO A, missions near Earth)\n\n.... Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2024-09-15T22:34Z and 2024-09-16T07:38Z (average arrival 2024-09-16T02:09Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-09-16T00:46Z and 2024-09-16T05:03Z (average arrival 2024-09-16T03:26Z) for 25% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 99% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-09-13_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA069/20240913_101200_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA069_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-09-13_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA069/20240913_101200_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA069_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-09-13_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA069/20240913_101200_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA069_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-09-13_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA069/20240913_101200_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA069_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-09-13_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA069/20240913_101200_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA069_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event is also predicted to have a glancing blow at Mars at 2024-09-18T04:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) and a minor impact at Parker Solar Probe at 2024-09-14T18:42Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20240913-AL-007).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-09-13_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA069/Detailed_results_20240913_101200_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA069.txt\n###\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"GST","messageID":"20240914-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/33415/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-09-14T00:44Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Geomagnetic Storm\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-09-14T00:44:28Z\n## Message ID: 20240914-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

An ensemble simulation was performed for this CME with 48 members which estimated the CME to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-09-10T12:27Z and 2024-09-11T04:34Z (average arrival 2024-09-10T18:52Z) for 97% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicated that there is a 69% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate). Full details of the modeled event are available here: https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-09-09_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA067/Detailed_results_20240908_034200_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA067.txt (see notification 20240910-AL-001). The arrival of this CME has likely been detected at STEREO A around 2024-09-10T21:00Z and might have also been detected at L1 around 2024-09-11T14:18Z (see notification 20240911-AL-002), however the analysis of the developing arrival signature at L1 is still ongoing.\n\nAdditionally, it was estimated that the leading edge of the C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2024-09-10T00:23Z would reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2024-09-12T16:57Z (plus minus 7 hours) with possible Kp index 5-8 (minor to severe) (see notifications 20240910-AL-002 and 20240910-AL-003). An ensemble simulation was performed for this CME with 24 members which estimated the CME to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-09-12T12:24Z and 2024-09-12T22:53Z (average arrival 2024-09-12T16:58Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 66% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 5-7 range (minor to strong). Full details of the modeled event are available here: https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-09-10_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA068/Detailed_results_20240910_002300_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA068.txt (see notification 20240910-AL-003).\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact the listed locations:\n\nCME Starting time | Predicted Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2024-09-05T01:48Z  Solar Orbiter at 2024-09-06T16:01Z, OSIRIS-APEX at 2024-09-06T16:00Z (minor impact) (see notification 20240905-AL-004).\n2024-09-05T07:24Z  Psyche at 2024-09-12T04:00Z (minor impact), OSIRIS-APEX at 2024-09-06T07:39Z, Solar Orbiter at 2024-09-06T04:35Z (see notification 20240905-AL-001).\n2024-09-05T11:23Z  Mars at 2024-09-09T14:00Z (minor impact), STEREO A at 2024-09-08T00:00Z (glancing blow). \n2024-09-06T14:48Z  STEREO A at 2024-09-09T16:00Z (minor impact).\n2024-09-08T01:36Z  Parker Solar Probe at 2024-09-09T16:59Z, STEREO A at 2024-09-10T16:04Z, Lucy at 2024-09-11T20:00Z (glancing blow), Mars at 2024-09-12T02:00Z (glancing blow) (see notifications 20240908-AL-001, 20240910-AL-001).\n2024-09-08T10:24Z  Solar Orbiter at 2024-09-09T16:07Z (see notification 20240909-AL-001).\n2024-09-09T01:25Z  Juno at 2024-09-20T08:58Z, Mars at 2024-09-12T00:09Z, STEREO A at 2024-09-12T00:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20240909-AL-006).\n2024-09-09T05:23Z  Psyche at 2024-09-15T08:00Z (minor impact), OSIRIS-APEX at 2024-09-10T00:35Z, Solar Orbiter at 2024-09-10T05:30Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20240909-AL-007).\n2024-09-10T00:23Z  Lucy at 2024-09-12T19:07Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2024-09-11T09:26Z, STEREO A at 2024-09-12T16:03Z, Mars at 2024-09-14T22:00Z (glancing blow) (see notifications 20240910-AL-002, 20240910-AL-003).\n2024-09-10T20:12Z  Solar Orbiter at 2024-09-11T22:32Z, OSIRIS-APEX at 2024-09-12T04:00Z (minor impact) (see notification 20240911-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4.33 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp <= 4.33 occurred during the synoptic period of 2024-09-04T12:00Z-15:00Z. This slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-09-04T09:40Z (see notification 20240904-AL-002), which may have been associated with the arrival of the S-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-09-01T03:24Z. This interplanetary shock was also detected by STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments at 2024-09-04T13:17Z. These arrival signatures are currently under analysis.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt briefly crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2024-09-04T14:55Z (see notifications 20240904-AL-003  and 20240904-AL-004) but subsided to near background levels by the end of 2024-09-04. This  elevation of energetic electron flux levels may have been associated with the previously mentioned arrival of a CME at L1 on 2024-09-04T09:40Z. This observed radiation belt enhancement may have also been influenced by an earlier arrival signature detected at L1 on 2024-09-03T00:37Z.\n\nSeveral solar energetic particle events were detected by STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES during the reporting period. At the beginning of the reporting period, the particle environment at STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES were elevated above background levels but below their respective thresholds (see report 20240828-7D-001 for more details from the prior reporting period). Starting at 2024-09-05T15:51Z, the flux of the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A briefly exceeded the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV (see notifications 20240905-AL-002 and 20240905-AL-003), subsiding below threshold approximately two hours later. This brief solar energetic particle event may have been associated with the far-sided O-type halo CME first detected in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-09-05T07:24Z (see notification 20240905-AL-001). \n\nAnother solar energetic particle event was detected by STEREO A, GOES, and SOHO on 2024-09-09, when the flux of 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A exceeded its threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-09-09T07:58Z (see notifications 20240909-AL-002 and 20240909-AL-004), the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded the threshold of 10 pfu starting at 2024-09-09T08:50Z (see notifications 20240909-AL-003, 20240909-AL-005), and the fluxes of the >15.8 MeV protons channels at SOHO exceeded the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-09-09T16:35Z (see notification 20240909-AL-008). The flux of > 100 MeV protons at GOES did not cross the threshold of 1 pfu but was elevated above background levels near this threshold on 2024-09-09. This SEP event at all three locations was likely associated with the far-sided O-type halo CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2024-09-09T05:23Z (see notification 20240909-AL-007). At STEREO A, the 13-100 MeV protons subsided below the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV around 2024-09-09T11:30Z but were elevated above threshold again starting at 2024-09-09T20:55Z (see notification 20240909-AL-010). This third solar energetic particle event at STEREO A was likely associated with the M3.4 class flare from the Active Region 13814 (N15E15) peaking at 2024-09-09T17:08Z. \n\nBy the end of the reporting period on 2024-09-10, the proton fluxes at STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES had subsided to below their respective thresholds towards background levels.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this reporting period due to the solar energetic particle events at GOES, SOHO, and STEREO A and the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above. \n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-09-04  02:43:00  03:11:00  02:55:00   M1.4   S22E49 ( 13813 ) \n2024-09-04  04:49:00  05:05:00  04:56:00   M1.2   S18E44 ( 13807 ) \n2024-09-04  05:55:00  06:07:00  06:01:00   M1.0   S12W13 ( 13806 ) \n2024-09-04  06:07:00  06:16:00  06:11:00   M1.0   S12W12 ( 13806 ) \n2024-09-04  13:08:00  13:27:00  13:21:00   M1.0   S22E44 ( 13813 ) \n2024-09-04  19:41:00  20:16:00  20:00:00   M1.2   S13E20 ( 13811 ) \n2024-09-05  00:17:00  00:24:00  00:20:00   M1.0   S15W73 ( 13807 ) \n2024-09-05  03:12:00  03:37:00  03:25:00   M1.1   S12W24 ( 13806 ) \n2024-09-05  03:37:00  03:49:00  03:44:00   M1.0   S23E33 ( 13813 ) \n2024-09-05  08:47:00  09:01:00  08:56:00   M2.8   S18W72 ( 13807 ) \n2024-09-05  09:02:00  09:10:00  09:04:00   M1.4   S15W77 ( 13807 ) \n2024-09-05  09:26:00  09:52:00  09:42:00   M1.6   S15W77 ( 13807 ) \n2024-09-05  13:20:00  13:35:00  13:25:00   M1.3   S15W80 ( 13807 ) \n2024-09-07  06:17:00  09:17:00  07:49:00   M1.6   S30E15 ( 13815 ) \n2024-09-08  15:07:00  15:56:00  15:30:00   M1.5   S15W30 ( 13811 ) \n2024-09-09  00:57:00  05:02:00  03:32:00   M1.0   S05W89 ( 13806 ) \n2024-09-09  05:18:00  05:39:00  05:30:00   M1.2   S30E03 ( 13819 ) \n2024-09-09  05:40:00  05:58:00  05:45:00   M1.8   S12W76 ( 13808 ) \n2024-09-09  08:41:00  09:02:00  08:50:00   M1.5   S12W86 ( 13806 ) \n2024-09-09  09:18:00  09:40:00  09:27:00   M1.1   N20E30 ( 13814 ) \n2024-09-09  09:57:00  10:48:00  10:27:00   M1.7   S12W87 ( 13806 ) \n2024-09-09  12:11:00  12:24:00  12:17:00   M1.0   S14W45 ( 13811 ) \n2024-09-09  16:58:00  17:16:00  17:08:00   M3.4   N15E15 ( 13814 ) \n2024-09-09  23:47:00  01:03:00  00:28:00   M1.2   N15E10 ( 13814 ) \n2024-09-10  15:34:00  16:02:00  15:47:00   M1.6   S12W90           \n2024-09-10  23:38:00  23:57:00  23:50:00   M1.0   N15W02 ( 13814 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-09-08T01:36Z     ~626            C                23/22                41                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-09-10T00:23Z     ~755            C                -5/26                43                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed (POS = Plane Of Sky):\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-09-05T01:48Z     ~684            C               153/19                28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-09-05T07:24Z     ~1329           O               171/11                54                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-09-05T11:23Z     ~590            C                53/10                24                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2024-09-06T11:48Z     ~592            C                93/-36               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-09-06T14:48Z     ~528            C                49/20                17                          SOHO                              \n2024-09-06T18:00Z     ~634            C                66/-62               14                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-09-07T01:36Z     ~500            C                68/-57               12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-09-08T10:24Z     ~842            C               148/6                 20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-09-09T01:25Z     ~957            C                81/13                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-09-09T05:23Z     ~1452           O              -133/18                45                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2024-09-10T20:12Z     ~955            C               180/-44               35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-09-11T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-09-17T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently ten active regions on the Earth-facing disk. The most notable Active Region on the disk is Active Region 13814 (N16W11) which produced several M-class flares toward the end of the reporting period and is likely to continue to be the source of significant solar activity as it traverses the Earth-facing disk. Three other Active Regions also produced notable flaring during the last few days: Active Regions 13806 and 13807 which have already rotated off the Earth-facing disk and Active Region 13811 (S12W75) which is expected to rotate behind the limb on or around 2024-09-12. These active regions may be the source of far-sided activity during the outlook period. An unnumbered active region currently located near S13E90 has recently produced an M1.8 flare on 2024-09-11 and could be the source of additional flaring activity from the Earth-facing disk during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and strong levels during the outlook period. Some enhancement in geomagnetic activity may be observed on 2024-09-11 due to the ongoing arrival at L1, with the interplanetary shock seen by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-09-11T14:18Z (see notification 20240911-AL-002). This arrival signature is still developing and is under analysis.  A minor to strong enhancement in geomagnetic activity is expected around 2024-09-12 due to the anticipated arrival of a C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2024-09-10T00:23Z and associated with M1.2 flare from Active Region 13814 (N15E10) which peaked at 2024-09-10T00:28Z (see notifications 20240910-AL-002 and 20240910-AL-003). Yet another minor to strong enhancement in geomagnetic activity is possible around 2024-09-13 due to the anticipated arrival of a C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2024-09-11T02:23Z and associated with M1.0 flare from Active Region 3814 (N16W03) which peaked at 2024-09-10T23:50Z (see notification 20240911-AL-003). Finally, a coronal hole currently observed to be crossing the central meridian near N40W00 along with another coronal hole currently centered around S33E20 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-09-15 and 2024-09-16, respectively.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"FLR","messageID":"20240912-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/33334/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-09-12T00:52Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - M5.0 Flare\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-09-12T00:52:31Z\n## Message ID: 20240912-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp = 5.67 occurred during the synoptic period 2024-08-28T00:00Z to 2024-08-28T03:00Z (see notifications 20240828-AL-001 and 20240828-AL-002). This moderate geomagnetic storm was associated with an interplanetary shock detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR during the previous reporting period around 2024-08-27T07:33Z (see notification 20240827-AL-001) that was caused by the arrival of the S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO imagery at 2024-08-23T02:00Z (see notifications 20240823-AL-002 and 20240824-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was elevated towards the end of the reporting period, but remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nDuring the reporting period, there was a solar energetic particle event detected by STEREO A (see notifications 20240901-AL-004 and 20240902-AL-001). The flux of 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-09-01T23:14Z. This SEP event was associated with the M5.5 flare from an unnumbered region (S25E90) which peaked at 2024-09-01T13:22Z (see notifications 20240901-AL-002 and 20240901-AL-003) and the associated O-type CME first seen in STEREO A COR2 at 2024-09-01T12:23Z. An additional enhancement was observed resulting in a significant increase in the flux of 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A starting at 2024-09-03T08:39Z (see notification 20240903-AL-003). This additional enhancement in the proton flux at STEREO A was likely associated with the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-09-03T08:12Z (see notifications 20240903-AL-001 and 20240903-AL-002).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES was elevated above background levels starting on 2024-09-01 following the M5.5 flare and associated O-type CME mentioned above, but remained below the threshold for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle event detected at STEREO A described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location

expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently six active regions on the Earth-facing disk. The most notable Active Regions on the disk include Active Region 13813 (S22E32) which produced six of the M-class flares during the week and may continue to exhibit similar level flaring throughout the outlook period. Active Regions 13807 (S15W68) and 13806 (S10W21) which also produced notable flaring during the week are expected to rotate off the Earth-facing disk on 2024-09-07 and 2024-09-10, respectively, and could be the source of far-sided activity during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity may be possible on or around 2024-09-06 due to the anticipated glancing blow to NASA missions near Earth from the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-09-03T20:12Z (see notification 20240904-AL-001). The >2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2024-09-04T15:55Z (see notifications 20240904-AL-003 and 20240904-AL-004) and may continue to remain elevated during the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20240904-AL-004","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/33171/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-09-04T15:27Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-09-04T15:27:36Z\n## Message ID: 20240904-AL-004\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
