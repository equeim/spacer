This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at very low levels during this reporting period.     \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period.  Geomagnetic Kp index reached level 6 (moderate) during the synoptic period 2016-12-21T15:00Z to 2016-12-21T18:00Z. This moderate elevation in geomagnetic activity was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2016-12-21 (see notifications 20161221-AL-001 and 20161221-AL-002).  The maximum value of solar wind speed reached >700 km/s on 2016-12-23.  \n\nThere were two coronal hole high speed streams detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments on 2016-12-21 and 2016-12-26, respectively.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2016-12-22T14:45Z and had remained elevated (crossing the threshold several times) for the entire reporting period.  These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above detected by DSCOVR at L1 (see notifications 20161222-AL-001, 20161222-AL-002, 20161224-AL-001, and 20161226-AL-001).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated electron fluxes on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-12-28T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-01-03T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be very low for the upcoming period.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.   Geomagnetic activity could increase due to the arrival of a coronal hole (currently located near the center of the solar disk) high speed stream at around 2016-12-31.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.   The maximum value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2016-12-09T18:00Z-24:00Z.  This slight elevation in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2016-12-07.  Solar wind speed reached values greater than 700 km/s on 2016-12-09.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2016-12-10T15:00Z. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above.  The fluxes remained elevated for a couple of days.  (See notifications 20161210-AL-001, 20161210-AL-002 and 20161212-AL-001).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevation on the energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above. \n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-12-12T06:54Z     ~599            C               135/23                27                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-12-14T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-12-20T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the next upcoming period.

Geomagnetic Kp index reached level 6 (moderate) during the synoptic period 2016-11-25T03:00Z to 2016-11-25T06:00Z. This moderate geomagnetic storm was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2016-11-24 (see notifications 20161125-AL-001 and 20161125-AL-003).  \n\nAround 2016-11-27 there was also a coronal hole high speed stream arrival detected at STEREO A.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2016-11-25T13:35Z, and remained elevated for the rest of the reporting period.  These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above (see notifications 20161125-AL-002, 20161125-AL-004, 20161127-AL-001, 20161129-AL-001). \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due the energetic electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt described above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2016-11-29  17:19:00  17:26:00  17:23:00   M1.0   S08E54 ( 12615 ) \n2016-11-29  23:29:00  23:40:00  23:38:00   M1.2   S08E54 ( 12615 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-11-30T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-12-06T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week due to the recent activity by active region 12615 currently located around S07E35.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to remain low for the upcoming week.  There is a possible small geomagnetic enhancement around 2016-12-04 due to a small coronal hole high speed stream.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
