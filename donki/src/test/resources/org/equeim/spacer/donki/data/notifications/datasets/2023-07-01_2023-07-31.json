Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO A between about 2023-07-31T15:59Z and 2023-08-01T05:26Z (average arrival 2023-07-31T21:51Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-07-31T20:28Z and 2023-08-01T10:36Z (average arrival 2023-08-01T02:48Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 88% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-29_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA035/20230728_223600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA035_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-29_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA035/20230728_223600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA035_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-29_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA035/20230728_223600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA035_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-29_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA035/20230728_223600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA035_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-29_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA035/20230728_223600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA035_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2023-07-28T22:36:00-CME-001) is also predicted to impact OSIRIS-REx at 2023-08-01T13:41Z and Parker Solar Probe at 2023-07-31T03:54Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20230729-AL-003).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-29_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA035/Detailed_results_20230728_223600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA035.txt\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20230729-AL-005","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/26245/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-07-29T15:00Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-07-29T15:00:56Z\n## Message ID: 20230729-AL-005\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate levels during this reporting period with 6 M-class flares, 3 O-type CMEs and 8 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-07-23T15:05Z may reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-07-26T05:31Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 3-4 (below minor) (see notification 20230723-AL-001). An ensemble simulation was performed for this CME with 24 members which estimated the CME to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-07-25T21:16Z and 2023-07-26T09:45Z (average arrival 2023-07-26T03:37Z) for 54% of simulations (see notification 20230724-AL-003).  The ensemble-based forecast indicated that there is a 66% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor to below minor). Full details of the modeled event are available at: https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-24_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA034/Detailed_results_20230723_150500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA034.txt. The arrival of this CME was likely detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-07-25T21:54Z (see notification 20230726-AL-001) and by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data around 2023-07-25T19:00Z. \n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs would impact other locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-07-19T23:12Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-07-22T01:00Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2023-07-24T11:00Z (glancing blows) (see notification 20230720-AL-001)\n2023-07-22T05:00Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-07-24T23:06Z (see notification 20230722-AL-001)\n2023-07-23T15:05Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-07-25T02:49Z, STEREO A at 2023-07-26T02:00Z (minor impact), and OSIRIS-REx at 2023-07-26T19:46Z (see notifications 20230723-AL-001, 20230724-AL-003)\n2023-07-24T17:53Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-07-26T09:55Z (see notification 20230724-AL-002)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4.67 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4.67 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-07-25T21:00Z to 2023-07-26T00:00Z. This minor enhancement of geomagnetic activity was caused by the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-07-25T21:54Z which was likely associated with the arrival of the O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO imagery at 2023-07-23T15:05Z described above.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period at 2023-07-19T16:55Z (see notifications 20230719-AL-002 and 20230719-AL-003). The elevated energetic electron flux levels were likely caused by a CME (and/or possibly a coronal hole high speed stream) that arrived during the previous reporting period (see report 20230719-7D-001). The energetic electron flux subsided to background levels late on 2023-07-20.\n\nAt the beginning of the reporting period, the particle environment was elevated above threshold due to an ongoing solar energetic particle event detected by STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES in the previous reporting period (see report 20230719-7D-001). The particle environment returned to under-threshold levels on 2023-07-20. Additionally, late on 2023-07-24 proton fluxes at GOES, SOHO and STEREO A became significantly enhanced but below threshold levels following a farsided O-type halo CME first seen in STEREO A at 2023-07-24T17:53Z (see notifications 20230724-AL-001 and 20230724-AL-002). The particle environment has been trending down to nominal levels at GOES, but is yet to return to background levels at STEREO A and SOHO.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle events detected at SOHO, GOES and STEREO A, and the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-07-19  10:49:00  11:02:00  10:57:00   M1.4   S25W90 ( 13363 ) \n2023-07-19  17:04:00  17:43:00  17:25:00   M3.8   S19W90 ( 13363 ) \n2023-07-22  03:12:00  03:55:00  03:37:00   M3.1   N25W50 ( 13372 ) \n2023-07-22  04:12:00  04:24:00  04:16:00   M1.0   N07W29 ( 13373 ) \n2023-07-25  01:36:00  02:24:00  02:03:00   M1.5   N25W52 ( 13376 ) \n2023-07-25  21:08:00  21:24:00  21:16:00   M1.6   S11E41 ( 13380 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-07-23T15:05Z     ~1028           O                15/11                45                          SOHO, STEREO A \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-07-19T17:36Z     ~868            C                93/6                 24                          SOHO, STEREO A     \n2023-07-19T23:12Z     ~881            C               54/35                 39                          SOHO, STEREO A                 \n2023-07-20T10:00Z     ~790            C          NONE(POS)/3                19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-07-20T23:24Z     ~589            C         NONE(POS)/-70               23                          SOHO        \n2023-07-22T04:12Z     ~535            C         NONE(POS)/-22               32                          SOHO                              \n2023-07-22T05:00Z     ~739            C               114/-2                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-07-22T19:12Z     ~553            C               129/65                26                          SOHO, STEREO A     \n2023-07-23T11:48Z     ~542            C          NONE(POS)/66               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                                   \n2023-07-24T07:24Z     ~1185           O               -95/52                41                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-07-24T17:53Z     ~1411           O               158/-20               45                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-07-26T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-08-01T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at minor to moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently eleven numbered active regions on the solar disk. Active Region 13376 (N23E78) produced four M-class flares within the last two days and may continue to exhibit flaring activity before rotating off the Earth-facing disk by 2023-07-27. Active Region 13380 (S11E29) has also produced an M-class flare during the reporting period and may continue to produce notable activity as it traverses the Earth-facing disk. Additionally, two unnumbered Active Regions may soon be rotating onto the east limb at around 20 and -15 degrees latitude, as seen in STEREO A EUV and SDO imagery.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor to moderate levels due to the recent interplanetary shock at L1 on 2023-07-25T21:54Z likely associated with the arrival of the above mentioned O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-07-23T15:05Z. Finally, there might be additional increases in geomagnetic activity from very minor coronal holes crossing the central meridian on 2023-07-24 and one at disk center today. These may become geoeffective starting around 2023-07-28. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20230726-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/26196/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-07-26T12:50Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-07-26T12:50:02Z\n## Message ID: 20230726-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO A between about 2023-07-25T19:14Z and 2023-07-26T02:33Z (average arrival 2023-07-26T00:05Z) for 41% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-07-25T21:16Z and 2023-07-26T09:45Z (average arrival 2023-07-26T03:37Z) for 54% of simulations.

This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-24_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA034/Detailed_results_20230723_150500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA034.txt\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230724-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/26179/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-07-24T20:30Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-07-24T20:30:42Z\n## Message ID: 20230724-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp = 4.67 occurred during synoptic periods of 2023-07-16T21:00Z to 2023-07-17T00:00Z and 2023-07-17T18:00Z to 2023-07-18T03:00Z. This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the Interplanetary Shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2023-07-16T18:35Z (see notification 20230716-AL-005) which may have been associated with the combined arrival of a C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-07-14T19:10Z (see notifications 20230715-AL-001 and 20230716-AL-003) possibly followed by a coronal hole high speed stream. This arrival was also detected by STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC data around 2023-07-16T12:40Z. This signature is still under analysis. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES rose to just below the threshold on the last day of the reporting period due to the above mentioned Interplanetary Shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2023-07-16T18:35Z and the complex arrival associated with it. The energetic electron flux at GOES was also somewhat elevated but below threshold on the first day of the reporting period in a continuation of a long lasting enhancement observed since 2023-06-27T12:50Z. \n\nTwo solar energetic particle events were detected during the reporting period.  The first solar energetic particle event was detected by GOES: the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2023-07-16T06:35Z (see notifications 20230716-AL-001 and 20230716-AL-004), reaching a peak of 18 pfu near 2023-07-16T07:30Z (minor solar radiation storm). This solar energetic particle event was likely associated with a back-sided partial halo O-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 coronagraph imagery at 2023-07-16T04:42Z (see notification 20230717-AL-002). This SEP event was preceded and likely contributed to by a relatively minor enhancement in the flux of > 10 MeV protons at GOES to under 2 pfu after 2023-07-15T20:25Z. The origin of this initial proton flux enhancement may have been a C8.8 class flare from Active Region 13363 peaking at 2023-07-15T20:01Z, and an O-type CME from behind the west limb first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-07-15T20:13Z.\n\nThe second solar energetic particle event was detected by STEREO A, SOHO and GOES. At STEREO A, the flux of 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-07-18T00:53Z (see notifications 20230718-AL-006 and 20230718-AL-007). At SOHO, the flux of the 28.2-50.1 protons channel exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-07-18T01:12Z (see notification 20230718-AL-011) and the flux of the 15.8-39.8 MeV channel at 2023-07-18T01:06Z. At GOES, the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2023-07-18T01:15Z (see notifications 20230718-AL-008 and 20230718-AL-009), eventually reaching a maximum of 620 pfu (moderate solar radiation storm). This solar energetic particle event was caused by a pair of M5-class flares from Active Region 13363, which peaked at 2023-07-17T23:33Z (M5.0 class flare) and at 2023-07-18T00:06Z (M5.7 class flare), respectively (see notifications 20230717-AL-004, 20230717-AL-005, 20230718-AL-001, and 20230718-AL-003), and by the associated O-type halo CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 coronagraph imagery at 2023-07-17T23:36Z (see notifications 20230718-AL-010, 20230718-AL-012 and 20230719-AL-001).\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle events detected at SOHO, STEREO A, and GOES, and the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-07-12  00:21:00  00:40:00  00:31:00   M1.4   S11W67 ( 13366 ) \n2023-07-12

Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-07-19T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-07-25T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary from moderate to high levels during the outlook period. The SEP event which started on the last day of the reported period is still in progress, with the flux of > 10 MeV protons at GOES declining but still above the threshold of 10 pfu. Proton fluxes at SOHO and STEREO A are already below their respective thresholds. There are currently seven numbered active regions on the Earth-facing disk. Recent M-class flaring has come from Active Region 13376 (N23E19), while Active Region 13372 (N23W21) was responsible for 7 M-class flares during the reporting period. There is also an unnumbered active region around latitude N15 currently rotating onto the east limb of the Earth-facing disk as seen from SDO AIA and STEREO A EUV imagery. This Active Region was likely responsible for a M-class flare from behind the east limb at the end of the reporting period. These active regions, as well as Active Region 13373 (N07E03) may produce further solar activity. Active Region 13363 (S21W95) has already rotated off the solar disk, but may still produce notable activity from beyond the limb. This region was responsible for producing multiple M-class flares and CMEs during the reporting period, including two M5-class flares and the associated CME responsible for the ongoing SEP event.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at moderate levels due to the predicted impact at L1 around 2023-07-19T18:28Z from the O-type CME first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-07-17T23:36Z  (+/- 7 hours) (see details above). Finally, there may be additional increases in geomagnetic activity from minor coronal holes near the disk center on 2023-07-17 and 2023-07-18, which may become geoeffective on/after 2023-07-20. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt most recently crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-07-19T16:55Z possibly due to the CME and/or coronal hole high speed stream arrivals mentioned above and will likely remain elevated during the beginning of the outlook period (see notification 20230719-AL-003). \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20230719-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/26101/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-07-19T17:24Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-07-19T17:24:12Z\n## Message ID: 20230719-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

For 32 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-07-16T16:49Z and 2023-07-17T04:07Z (average arrival 2023-07-16T22:30Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally, the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-07-16T20:53Z and 2023-07-17T08:49Z (average arrival 2023-07-17T03:01Z) for 100% of simulations.

This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-15_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA031/Detailed_results_20230714_191000_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA031.txt\n###\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"SEP","messageID":"20230716-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/26000/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-07-16T12:37Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - SEP\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-07-16T12:37:07Z\n## Message ID: 20230716-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-07-13T18:12Z and 2023-07-14T18:53Z (average arrival 2023-07-14T10:07Z) for 95% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally, the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-07-14T00:35Z and 2023-07-14T21:58Z (average arrival 2023-07-14T14:49Z) for 87% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 84% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA030/20230711_192400_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA030_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA030/20230711_192400_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA030_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA030/20230711_192400_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA030_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA030/20230711_192400_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA030_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA030/20230711_192400_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA030_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes: This CME event is also predicted to have an impact at Parker Solar Probe at 2023-07-13T10:23Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2023-07-15T10:59Z (plus/minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling.\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA030/Detailed_results_20230711_192400_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA030.txt\n###\n\n"},{"messageType":"Report","messageID":"20230712-7D-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25927/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-07-12T20:07Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (CCMC DONKI)\n## Message Type: Weekly Space Weather Summary Report for July 05, 2023 - July 11, 2023\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-07-12T20:07:11Z\n## Report Coverage Begin Date: 2023-07-05T00:00Z\n## Report Coverage End Date: 2023-07-11T23:59Z\n## Message ID: 20230712-7D-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The energetic electron flux levels subsided to background levels late on 2023-07-05. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were at near-background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux levels described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-07-05  18:36:00  19:21:00  18:58:00   M1.0   N16W95 ( 13354 ) \n2023-07-06  10:32:00  11:07:00  10:49:00   M1.0   N15W90 ( 13354 ) \n2023-07-07  06:17:00  06:38:00  06:29:00   M4.0   S21W13 ( 13359 ) \n2023-07-10  03:29:00  04:12:00  03:55:00   M2.3   S13W49 ( 13366 ) \n2023-07-10  22:06:00  22:29:00  22:18:00   M1.4   S13W62 ( 13358 ) \n2023-07-11  14:19:00  14:45:00  14:35:00   M2.0   N25E90 ( 13379 ) \n2023-07-11  16:02:00  16:25:00  16:12:00   M1.1   N25E89 ( 13372 ) \n2023-07-11  16:25:00  16:30:00  16:27:00   M1.0   N25E89 ( 13372 ) \n2023-07-11  17:51:00  18:16:00  18:08:00   M6.8   N25E88 ( 13372 ) \n2023-07-11  19:20:00  19:39:00  19:29:00   M1.0   N25E88 ( 13372 ) \n2023-07-11  22:04:00  22:24:00  22:15:00   M5.8   N26E88 ( 13372 ) \n2023-07-11  23:34:00  23:45:00  23:37:00   M1.2   S19W59 ( 13368 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-07-06T09:12Z     ~532            C                 7/-21               45                          SOHO                              \n2023-07-10T04:00Z     ~901            C                37/-10               45                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-07-11T19:24Z     ~858            C                -10/-35              39                          SOHO, STEREO A                       \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-07-06T21:12Z     ~549            C               -50/59                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-07-10T04:24Z     ~858            C              -178/-3                46                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-07-10T12:00Z     ~663            C               95/-10                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-07-10T18:09Z     ~545            C               105/73                35                          SOHO                              \n2023-07-11T16:36Z     ~623            C               155/16                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-07-12T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date: 2023-07-18T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at high levels during the outlook period. There are currently twelve numbered active regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13372 (N25E75) produced seven M-class flares between 2023-07-11 and 2023-07-12 and may continue to produce notable flaring activity as it rotates towards the central meridian. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor storm levels due to the predicted impacts from the C-type CMEs first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-07-10T04:00Z and 2023-07-11T19:24Z, respectively (see details above). Finally, there may be additional enhancement in geomagnetic activity late this week due to the possible arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream from a diffuse coronal hole currently centered around N22W01. This coronal hole may reach geoeffective longitudes on or around 2023-07-16. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230712-AL-004","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25921/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-07-12T13:46Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-REx, Parker Solar Probe, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-07-12T13:46:25Z\n## Message ID: 20230712-AL-004\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

For 32 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-07-12T15:53Z and 2023-07-13T03:49Z (average arrival 2023-07-12T20:40Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally, the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-07-12T17:22Z and 2023-07-13T05:31Z (average arrival 2023-07-12T22:13Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 68% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor to below minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-10_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA029/20230710_040000_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA029_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-10_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA029/20230710_040000_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA029_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-10_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA029/20230710_040000_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA029_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-10_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA029/20230710_040000_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA029_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-10_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA029/20230710_040000_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA029_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes: \n\nThis CME event is also predicted to have an impact at OSIRIS-REx at 2023-07-13T11:45Z and Parker Solar Probe at 2023-07-11T09:57Z (plus/minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling.\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set.

An ensemble simulation was performed for this CME with 32 members which estimated the CME to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-07-06T18:35Z and 2023-07-07T04:21Z (average arrival 2023-07-06T23:12Z) for 100% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 90% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 5-7 range (minor to strong) (see notification 20230704-AL-003). Full details of the modeled event are available at: https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-04_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA028/Detailed_results_20230704_091600_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA028.txt. \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained elevated near or above the threshold of 1000 pfu during the entire reporting period. The elevated energetic electron flux levels observed since 2023-06-27T12:50Z are likely caused by combined effects of the arrival of a CME and a coronal hole high speed stream starting in the previous reporting period. The electron flux may have been further enhanced by additional minor CME arrivals detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE around 2023-06-29T08:20Z and 2023-06-30T11:20Z (see notifications 20230629-AL-002, 20230701-AL-001, and 20230703-AL-002). The maximum sustained solar wind speed at L1 reached approximately 575 km/s. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period.  \n\nSpace Weather Impact: \nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above) \nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location          \n2023-06-28  08:26:00  08:59:00  08:44:00   M1.9   N23W62 ( 13340 )  \n2023-06-29  14:00:00  14:23:00  14:15:00   M3.8   N17W15 ( 13354 )  \n2023-07-01  22:07:00  22:31:00  22:23:00   M1.1   S22E57 ( 13359 )  \n2023-07-02  02:29:00  02:40:00  02:35:00   M2.0   S22E55 ( 13359 )  \n2023-07-02  22:54:00  23:58:00  23:14:00   X1.0   N13W56 ( 13354 )  \n2023-07-03  06:43:00  06:59:00  06:53:00   M1.3   S12E39 ( 13358 )  \n2023-07-04  12:20:00  12:55:00  12:35:00   M1.4   N16W80 ( 13354 )  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s): \n\nEarth directed: \nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)   \n2023-07-04T04:36Z     ~635            C               -14/-22               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                     \n\nNon-Earth directed: \nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)   \n2023-06-29T17:00Z     ~589            C                 0/37                14                          SOHO, STEREO A                     \n\n## Space Weather Outlook: \n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-07-05T00:00Z  \n## Outlook Coverage End Date: 2023-07-11T23:59Z \n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently seven numbered active regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13354 produced an X-class flare, 2 M-class flares, and most of the C-class flares during the reporting period before rotating off the Sun-Earth facing disk on 2023-07-05. It may continue produce some activity on the backside of the Sun. There is at least one unnumbered active region around latitude S20 rotating onto the east limb of the Earth-facing disk as seen from SDO AIA and STEREO A EUV imagery. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at moderate levels due to the predicted impact from the C-type CME first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-07-04T04:36Z (see details above). The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt most recently crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-07-05T06:15Z due to the coronal hole high speed stream and CME arrivals mentioned above and will likely remain elevated during the beginning of the outlook period (see notification 20230705-AL-001). Finally, there may be additional increases in geomagnetic activity from coronal holes currently centered around N30W05 and S45E20, respectively. The former may become geoeffective around 2023-07-08. \n\n## Notes:  \nSCORE CME typification system: \nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s \nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s \nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s \nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s \nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20230705-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25822/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-07-05T15:48Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-07-05T15:48:11Z\n## Message ID: 20230705-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-07-04_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA028/Detailed_results_20230704_091600_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA028.txt\n###\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230704-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25817/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-07-04T15:48Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (OSIRIS-REx, Parker Solar Probe, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-07-04T15:48:41Z\n## Message ID: 20230704-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
