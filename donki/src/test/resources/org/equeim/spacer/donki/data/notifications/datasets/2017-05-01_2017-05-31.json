There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it was estimated that the S-type CME (<500 km/s) that started on 2017-05-23T05:00Z may have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth around 2017-05-26T18:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20170523-AL-002).  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during several synoptic periods from 2017-05-20T00:00Z to 2017-05-20T18:00Z.  This slight enhancement in the geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2017-05-19.  \n\nSTEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream on 2017-05-18.  Solar wind speed values reached >600 km/s on 2017-05-19.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-05-21T12:25Z.  The significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 have remained elevated since 2015-05-21 crossing the threshold several times.  This elevation in the electron flux is associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above (see notifications 20170521-AL-001, 20170521-AL-002, and 20170523-AL-001).   \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-05-21T01:36Z     ~565            C               -90/-12               13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-05-24T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-05-30T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  There are a few active regions on the solar disk that could produce solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.  Currently, the > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt is enhanced to values of ~98,000 pfu due to the high speed stream described above.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it was estimated that the S-type CME starting on 2017-05-13T22:00Z (~340 km/s) will have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth around 2017-05-17T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20170515-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic period of 2017-05-15T09:00Z-12:00Z and 2017-05-15T18:00Z-21:00Z. This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was caused by the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2017-05-15. \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed   \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-05-17T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-05-23T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  There are a few active regions on the far side of the sun and several that will rotate to the Earth's facing solar disk in the next few days that could produce solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be moderate for the upcoming week.  Currently, solar wind conditions at Earth are going back to nominal levels after being under the influence of the coronal hole high speed stream described above.  Another coronal hole high speed stream is expected to arrive at L1 around 2017-05-20.  On its last rotation, this high speed stream increased geomagnetic activity to moderate levels and elevated the energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=3 for the reporting period.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was above the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for several periods between 2017-04-26T10:20Z - 2017-04-27T00:55Z, 2017-04-27T06:37Z - 2017-04-28T00:05Z and 2017-04-28T08:45Z - 2017-04-28T21:45Z.  This enhancement on the energetic electron flux was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream that started on 2017-04-21 (see notifications 20170423-AL-002, 20170425-AL-001, and 20170427-AL-001).  \n\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the enhanced electron fluxes on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.  \n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-04-28T21:24Z     ~580            C               -97/2                 17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-05-03T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-05-09T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week as there are only a few very small active regions present on the solar surface. STEREO A is expected to enter a coronal hole high speed stream this coming week due to the large equatorial CH currently close to disk center.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
