This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low levels during this reporting period.  There were no significant flares or CMEs. \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at strong levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=7 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=7 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2018-08-26T03:00Z-09:00Z.  This strong geomagnetic storm was associated with the arrival detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-08-25T06:00Z of the S-type CME (<500 km/s) that started on 2018-08-20T21:24Z (see notifications 20180826-AL-001 and 20180826-AL-002).  The CME arrival was also combined with a coronal hole high speed stream detected at DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-08-26 that increased geomagnetic activity to moderate levels with Kp=6 for the synoptic periods of 2018-08-26T15:00Z-18:00Z and 2018-08-27T15:00Z-18:00Z (see notification 20180827-AL-001).  Solar wind speed reached values of ~650 km/s on 2018-08-27.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt were elevated above the threshold level of 10^5 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period on 2018-08-22 and crossed the threshold again starting at 2018-08-26T18:40Z.  These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 on 2018-08-22 were associated with a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-08-19 (see notification 20180822-AL-001).  On 2018-08-26, the energetic electron fluxes were associated to the combination of the CME and coronal high speed stream arrival described above (see notifications 20180826-AL-003, 20180826-AL-004 and 20180828-AL-001).  Currently, these energetic electron fluxes are still elevated above the threshold of 10^5 pfu with values of 197,000 pfu.  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the geomagnetic storm and energetic electron fluxes on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2018-08-29T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2018-09-04T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  There are several active regions present on the solar surface that could produce some flare and CME activity.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week due to the possible arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream around 2018-08-30.  Currently, solar wind speed at DSCOVR/ACE is still slightly elevated at values of ~500 km/s due to the coronal hole high speed stream detected on 2018-08-26.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There were no significant flares or CMEs. \n   \nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2018-08-15T12:00Z-15:00Z, 2018-08-15T21:00Z-2018-08-16T03:00Z, 2018-08-17T03:00Z-06:00Z,   2018-08-18T06:00Z-09:00Z, 2018-08-20T00:00Z-03:00Z and 2018-08-20T18:00Z-21:00Z. This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of coronal hole high speed streams detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-08-14 and 2018-08-19. Solar wind speed reached values of ~550 km/s on 2018-08-17 and ~650 km/s on 2018-08-20.\n\nThe >0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2018-08-18T16:10Z and at 2018-08-20T22:50Z. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the two coronal hole high speed streams described above (see notifications 20180819-AL-001 and 20180820-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed   \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2018-08-22T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2018-08-28T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week. There are two active regions present at the solar surface that have some potential for flares and CME activity.
