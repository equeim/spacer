No significant solar flares or CMEs were detected. Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CME (starting on 2017-08-28T18:39Z), could have a glancing blow impact to missions near Earth around 2017-09-01T06:00Z (plus/minus 7 hours).  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.   The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic period of 2017-08-29T18:00Z-21:00Z.  This slight enhancement was associated with a coronating interaction region preceding a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2017-08-29.  \n\nIMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a CME (starting at 2017-08-18T13:48Z) around 2017-08-23T04:30Z.\n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)        \nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-08-28T18:39Z     ~491            S                36/7                 19                          STEREO A, SOHO                  2017-08-29T01:07Z\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-08-18T13:48Z     ~496            S              -109/-9                21                          SOHO                            2017-08-18T21:09Z\n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-08-30T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-09-05T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be slow to moderate.  There a couple of active regions visible on the solar surface from the SDO and STEREO A imagery that have the potential to produce solar flares and coronal mass ejections.   Geomagnetic activity is expected to be moderate for the upcoming week due to the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-08-31.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

In addition, there was 1 C-type CME originating from  active region 12671 (see details below).  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=6 was reached during the synoptic period of 2017-08-22T00:00Z - 2017-08-22T03:00Z, which was associated with a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2017-08-17.  This high speed stream produced extended periods of Kp=3-5 between 2017-08-17 to 2017-08-21 with solar wind speeds reaching values of >700 km/s on 2017-08-20. The moderate enhancement of Kp=6 occurred when the coronal hole high speed stream was combined with an additional solar wind transient that reached Earth by the end of 2017-08-21.\n\nPLASTIC/IMPACT instruments at STEREO A detected the CME arrival of an S-type CME (<500 km/s) around 2017-08-18T17:00Z.\n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-08-19T18:10Z.

There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.\n\nSTEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data detected a CME arrival around 2017-07-30T02:00Z.  This signature may be associated with the CME starting on 2017-07-28T05:36Z (see notification 20170728-AL-002).  Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, this CME was also estimated to impact Spitzer at 2017-07-31T16:21Z and Mars (glancing blow) at 2017-08-03T04:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-07-24T15:05Z.  The fluxes remained elevated several days crossing the threshold several times (see notifications 20170726-AL-001 and 20170728-AL-001).  These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2017-07-20.  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-07-28T05:36Z     ~574            C              -136/4                 38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-08-02T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-08-08T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate.  The recently numbered active region 12670 located around S05E70 has potential of producing solar flares and coronal mass ejections.   Geomagnetic activity is expected to be moderate for the upcoming week due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-08-03.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
