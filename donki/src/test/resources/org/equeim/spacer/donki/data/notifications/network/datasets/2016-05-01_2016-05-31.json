There were 3 C-type CMEs and 1 O-type CME (see details below).   Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it was estimated that the CME starting on 2016-05-15T15:36Z may impact Dawn (glancing blow) around 2016-05-26T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20160515-AL-001, 20160515-AL-002, 20160515-AL-003).  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.  The highest values of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2016-05-15T15:00Z-18:00Z and 2016-05-17T06:00Z-09:00Z.  These periods of minor elevated geomagnetic activity were associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 on 2016-05-14.  The highest value of solar wind speed reached 585 km/s on 2016-05-17.   \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was above the threshold level of 10^5 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period on 2016-05-11.  GOES 13 \"greater than 0.8 MeV\" integral electron flux was significantly elevated, reaching values of 162,000 pfu on 2016-05-11T17:55Z and it remained above the threshold for several days until 2016-05-13.  This elevation of the energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 on 2016-05-08 (see notifications 20160509-AL-002 and 20160511-AL-001).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES were slightly elevated on 2016-05-15 due to the coronal mass ejection that started on 2016-05-15T15:36Z, but remained below the threshold of 10 pfu for the entire reporting period.  The 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-05-11T03:24Z     ~700            C                44/22                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2016-05-11T11:24Z     ~688            C                93/38                11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2016-05-14T03:12Z     ~535            C               -92/-13               19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2016-05-15T15:36Z     ~1198           O                68/17                36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-05-18T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-05-24T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.

There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at strong levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=7 for the reporting period.  Geomagnetic Kp index reached level 7 (strong) during the synoptic periods of 2016-05-08T03:00Z-06:00Z and 2016-05-09T00:00Z-03:00Z. This strong geomagnetic storm was associated with the arrival detected by ACE at L1 of a coronal hole high speed stream on 2016-05-08 (see notifications 20160508-AL-001, 20160508-AL-002, 20160508-AL-003).  Solar wind speed reached values of ~766 km/s on 2016-05-09.  \n\nA possible arrival was detected by the STEREO Ahead magnetic field and plasma data on 2016-05-04T06:00Z. The arrival could be associated with a filament eruption from the far side near an active region seen in STEREO Ahead EUVI images near N30W60.  Alternatively, it could be related to an eruption close to the disk center observed from STEREO A with an associated CME starting at 2016-04-30T08:24Z.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu.  GOES 13 \"greater than 0.8 MeV\" integral electron flux was above 10^5 pfu starting at 2016-05-09T15:50Z. This elevation has continued for several days (see notifications 20160509-AL-001, 20160509-AL-002 and 20160511-AL-001) and had reached values of 186,000 pfu on 2016-05-10.  This significantly elevated electron flux is associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above.  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-05-10T21:17Z     ~674            C               -85/15                12                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-05-11T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-05-17T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  There are several active regions present in the solar disk, especially the active regions on the far side, that are capable of producing solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to remain low for the upcoming reporting period.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low to moderate levels during this reporting period.  There were 2 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period.  Geomagnetic Kp index reached level 6 (moderate) during the synoptic period 2016-05-02T03:00Z to 2016-05-02T06:00Z. This increase in geomagnetic activity was possibly caused by the arrival detected by ACE at L1 of a coronal hole high speed stream starting around 2016-05-01 with a possible combined arrival of several slow speed (<500 km/s) CMEs originating from the active region 12535 starting on 2016-04-28 (see notifications 20160429-AL-001, 20160502-AL-001, and 20160502-AL-002). The highest value of solar wind speed reached 636 km/s on 206-05-03.  \n\nAn arrival was detected by the STEREO Ahead magnetic field and plasma data on 2016-04-27T09:00Z of the CMEs that started on 2016-04-24T23:36Z and 2016-04-25T05:12Z (see notification 20160425-AL-001).  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period, but have been slightly elevated at the end of the reporting period due to the coronal hole high speed stream described above. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-04-30T08:24Z     ~589            C              -102/39                13                          STEREO A                          \n2016-05-01T06:24Z     ~596            C              -120/37                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-05-04T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-05-10T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  There are several active regions present in the solar disk, especially the active regions 12539 and 12541, that are capable of producing solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  Geomagnetic activity is also expected to slightly increase due to the arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream around 2016-05-07.  \n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
