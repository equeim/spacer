This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low levels during this reporting period.  There were 5 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-02-17T21:24Z may impact Mars at 2022-02-22T00:31Z and OSIRIS-REx  at 2022-02-21T17:27Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220218-AL-001.  \n\nIn addition, a four-CME simulation including three S-type CMEs and the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-02-18T18:12Z modeled potential impacts to Earth, Solar Orbiter, and STEREO A.  The combined leading edge of the CMEs was predicted to reach Earth at 2022-02-22T12:00Z (glancing blow), Solar Orbiter at 2022-02-21T11:43Z, and STEREO A at 2022-02-22T10:44Z (plus minus 7 hours).  Interplanetary shocks detected by the IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments at STEREO A at 2022-02-22T10:00Z and 2022-02-22T18:00Z may possibly be associated with individual arrivals of these CMEs.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 5 for the reporting period. Two separate synoptic periods of Kp = 5 were observed during the reporting period.  The first synoptic period was from 2022-02-20T00:00Z-03:00Z and was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-02-19.  The influence of this HSS continued throughout the reporting period with an extended period of negative Bz interplanetary magnetic field component observed at L1 which may have caused the second period of Kp = 5 during the 2022-02-22T06:00Z-09:00Z synoptic period.  An interplanetary shock detected by the IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments at STEREO A at 2022-02-17T12:01Z may have been associated with the arrival of this same coronal hole high speed stream. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was above the threshold level of 1000 pfu during the first three days of the reporting period due to a continued radiation belt enhancement from the previous reporting period (see notification 20220217-AL-001), but subsided to background levels for the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all slightly elevated, but below threshold levels for the entire reporting period.  These elevated proton levels were associated with the R-type CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-02-15T22:09Z (see notification 20220216-AL-001).\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-02-18T18:12Z     ~562            C               -39/27                25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-02-17T21:24Z     ~702            C               151/7                 45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-02-18T23:48Z     ~551            C              -114/36                21                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-02-20T01:25Z     ~555            C              -110/31                19                          SOHO                              \n2022-02-20T04:24Z     ~575            C               -93/30                25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-02-23T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-03-01T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the upcoming week.  There are currently six numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing solar disk.  Active Region 12953 (N17W05) has been mostly quiet during the reporting period.  Active Regions 12955 (N14E56) and 12954 (N18E45) have been responsible for at least one C-type CME, several S-type CMEs, and some C-class flaring during the reporting period.  This activity from these Active Regions may continue throughout the outlook period.  Active Regions 12948 (S28W53), 12950 (N22W37), and 12952 (S24E01) have decayed and are expected to remain quiet for the upcoming period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period.

The initial simulation also indicated that the CME may be in the proximity of Parker Solar Probe around 2022-02-16T06:00Z (plus minus 7 hours).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-02-10T15:00Z-21:00Z and 2022-02-11T18:00Z-21:00Z. The elevated value of Kp on 2022-02-10 was associated with the combined arrival detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-02-09T20:10Z (see notification 20220210-AL-001) of the CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-02-06T14:09Z (see notifications 20220206-AL-002, 20220206-AL-003, and 20220207-AL-001) and the CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-02-06T15:38Z (see notifications 20220206-AL-003 and 20220207-AL-001).  The elevated value of Kp on 2022-02-11 may have been associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-02-11. The solar wind speed reached a maximum value of approximately 580 km/s on 2022-02-12.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was elevated above the threshold level of 1000 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period due to the lingering effects of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-02-05, which solar wind speed reached a maximum of approximately 639 km/s (see notifications 20220206-AL-001 and 20220208-AL-001).  After briefly dropping below the threshold level on 2022-02-10, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu again at 2022-02-10T09:25Z (see notification 20220210-AL-002). This elevated energetic electron flux was likely associated with the combined arrival detected at L1 on 2022-02-09T20:10Z described above (see notification 20220210-AL-001). The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu again at 2022-02-13T10:30Z (see notifications 20220213-AL-001 and 20220215-AL-001). These elevated energetic electron fluxes were likely associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-02-11 also described above. The energetic electron flux has remained significantly elevated through the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the ongoing radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-02-12  08:25:00  08:56:00  08:44:00   M1.4   S16W88 (12939) \n2022-02-14  17:02:00  17:51:00  17:31:00   M1.0   N26W62 (12941) \n2022-02-15  17:54:00  18:31:00  18:15:00   M1.3   N26W81 (12941) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-02-11T01:36Z     ~600            C               144/14                49                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-02-12T17:48Z     ~925            C                94/-17               42                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-02-15T22:09Z     ~2554           R              -158/30                51                          SOHO, STEREO A\n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-02-16T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-02-22T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the upcoming week. There are currently seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing solar disk. Active Region 12941 (N24W79), which is currently at Beta-Gamma magnetic configuration, has been responsible for two M-class flares on 2022-02-14 and 2022-02-15 and may remain active as it rotates off the Earth-facing disk by 2022-02-17.  Active Region 12947 (N15W71), which is currently at Alpha magnetic configuration, is expected to remain quiet and should rotate off the Earth-facing disk by 2022-02-17.  Active Region 12949 (N24W12), currently at Beta-Gamma magnetic configuration, was just numbered on 2022-02-16 and may be active throughout the outlook period.  Active Regions 12943 (S20W37), 12946 (S09E11), 12948 (S27E51), and 12950 (N21E53) are expected to remain relatively quiet throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES has remained significantly elevated largely due to the effects of the previously mentioned combined arrival at L1 of two CMEs and the arrival at L1 of a coronal hole high speed stream on 2022-02-11. There is a northern extension of the south pole coronal hole that crossed the Earth-facing central meridian on 2022-02-16 and may become geoeffective towards the second half of the outlook period around 2022-02-20. Additionally, a coronal hole structure centered near N20E20 on 2022-02-16, as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO, may also become geoeffective around 2022-02-21.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220216-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/19205/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-02-16T22:38Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Juno)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-02-16T22:38:52Z\n## Message ID: 20220216-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at minor levels during this reporting period.  There were 5 C-type CMEs detailed below.   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the combined leading edge of the C-type CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-02-06T14:09Z and the S-type CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-02-06T15:38Z may arrive at Solar Orbiter at 2022-02-08T22:29Z, STEREO B at 2022-02-09T16:42Z and at NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-02-09T23:08Z. Additionally, heliospheric ensemble modeling with 48 ensemble members predicted that the combined leading edge of these two CMEs will reach STEREO B between about 2022-02-09T09:03Z and 2022-02-09T21:28Z (average arrival 2022-02-09T15:42Z) for 95% of simulations, STEREO A between about 2022-02-09T02:40Z and 2022-02-09T12:24Z (average arrival 2022-02-09T07:57Z) for 64% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-02-09T07:04Z and 2022-02-09T21:11Z (average arrival 2022-02-09T14:09Z) for 100% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 95% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate) (see notifications 20220206-AL-002, 20220206-AL-003 and 20220207-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. \nThe highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-02-03T06:00Z-12:00Z and 2022-02-04T15:00Z-21:00Z. The elevated values of Kp on 2022-02-03 were probably associated with the shock arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-02-01T21:37Z of the C-type CME observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-29T23:36Z (see notifications 20220130-AL-001, 20220130-AL-002 and 20220202-AL-001). Strong compression of the magnetosphere was detected following the arrival of the flux rope of this CME about 2022-02-02T19:43Z. Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2022-02-03T07:40Z (see notifications 20220203-AL-001 and 20220203-AL-002). In addition, elevated values of Kp on 2022-02-04 might have been associated with a glancing blow from a C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-02-01T07:12Z (see notification 20220204-AL-003).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt first crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu beginning at 2022-02-04T13:10Z in association with the above mentioned arrival of the C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-29T23:36Z (see notifications 20220204-AL-001 and 20220204-AL-002). Shortly following this radiation belt electron enhancement, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu again at 2022-02-05T12:05Z. These elevated energetic electron fluxes were likely associated to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-02-05, which reached a maximum speed of approximately 639 km/s (see notifications 20220206-AL-001 and 20220208-AL-001). The energetic electron flux has remained significantly elevated through the reporting period. \n  \nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-02-06T14:09Z     ~555            C                -5/-18               40                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-02-03T03:53Z     ~534            C                93/-22               37                          STEREO A                          \n2022-02-03T15:23Z     ~774            C               -83/18                16                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-02-03T21:24Z     ~604            C               142/11                30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-02-04T00:12Z     ~547            C                53/4                 28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-02-09T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-02-15T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the upcoming week. There are currently four numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing solar disk. Active Region 12941 (N23W01), which is currently at Beta-Gamma magnetic configuration, may reach longitudes that are favorable for magnetic connectivity with Earth in the second half of the outlook period. Active Region 12939 (N21W37), currently at Beta magnetic configuration, has been producing C-class flares and might remain active until it rotates off the Earth-facing disk by 2022-02-12. Several unnumbered Active Regions recently rotated onto the STEREO A-facing disk (above N25) and may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk early in the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES has remained significantly elevated largely due to the effects of the previously mentioned arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-02-05. We are now awaiting the predicted arrival at L1 of the combined leading edge of the C-type and S-type CMEs initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-02-06T14:09Z and 2022-02-06T15:38Z respectively. The coronal hole structure situated around S25E13 may become geoeffective towards the second half of the outlook period around 2022-02-14. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20220208-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/19120/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-02-08T14:25Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-02-08T14:25:31Z\n## Message ID: 20220208-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CMEs with IDs 2022-02-06T14:09:00-CME-001 and 2022-02-06T15:38:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20220206-AL-003). Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CMEs may impact STEREO A and STEREO B. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the combined leading edge of the CMEs will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2022-02-09T02:40Z and 2022-02-09T12:24Z (average arrival 2022-02-09T07:57Z) for 64% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2022-02-09T09:03Z and 2022-02-09T21:28Z (average arrival 2022-02-09T15:42Z) for 95% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CMEs are estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-02-09T07:04Z and 2022-02-09T21:11Z (average arrival 2022-02-09T14:09Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 95% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-02-06_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012/20220206_153800_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-02-06_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012/20220206_153800_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-02-06_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012/20220206_153800_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-02-06_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012/20220206_153800_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-02-06_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012/20220206_153800_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-02-06_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012/20220206_153800_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012_STA_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-02-06_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012/20220206_153800_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-02-06_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012/20220206_153800_ncmes2_sims48_LAHAINA012_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThe CME events (2022-02-06T14:09:00-CME-001 and 2022-02-06T15:38:00-CME-001) are also predicted to impact Solar Orbiter at 2022-02-08T22:29Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20220206-AL-003).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

Additionally, another C-type CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-01-28T02:53Z was estimated to potentially impact Parker Solar Probe around 2022-01-29T18:27Z (plus minus 7 hours).\n\nIt was also estimated that the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-29T23:36Z, associated with an M1.1 flare from Active Region 12936, may impact Solar Orbiter at 2022-02-01T11:35Z (plus minus 7 hours), STEREO A at 2022-02-01T18:24Z (plus minus 7 hours), STEREO B at 2022-02-01T20:03Z (plus minus 7 hours), and NASA missions near Earth at 2022-02-01T19:36Z (plus minus 7 hours). Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model run with 48 ensemble members predicted that the leading edge of the CME may impact STEREO A between about 2022-01-31T21:42Z and 2022-02-01T22:59Z (average arrival 2022-02-01T09:26Z) for 100% of simulations, STEREO B between about 2022-02-01T00:02Z and 2022-02-02T00:57Z (average arrival 2022-02-01T11:51Z) for 93% of simulations, and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-01-31T20:57Z and 2022-02-02T02:10Z (average arrival 2022-02-01T09:07Z) for 100% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicated a 64% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate) (see notifications 20220130-AL-001 and 20220130-AL-002). The arrival of this CME was associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-02-01T21:37Z (see notification 20220202-AL-001), and was also detected by the IMPACT instrument at STEREO A around 2022-02-01T22:00Z.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods from 2022-01-28T21:00Z to 2022-01-29T09:00Z and 2022-01-29T12:00Z-15:00Z. These slightly elevated values of Kp may have been associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-01-28. Additionally, the highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods 2022-02-01T21:00Z  2022-02-02-T00:00Z. This slightly elevated value of Kp was likely caused by the arrival of the C-type CME first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-29T23:36Z with an associated interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-02-01T21:37Z as described above (see notification 20220202-AL-001).  \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu beginning at 2022-01-31T10:45Z and remained elevated throughout the remainder of the reporting period (see notifications 20220131-AL-001 and 20220131-AL-002). The elevated energetic electron flux levels were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-01-28, which reached a maximum speed of approximately 550 km/s on 2022-01-29.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-01-29  22:45:00  00:24:00  23:32:00   M1.1   N17E10 ( 12936 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-01-29T23:36Z     ~628            C                -9/3                 45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-01-26T21:23Z     ~544            C              -138/-6                44                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-01-28T02:53Z     ~638            C              -174/17                31                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-02-02T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-02-08T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. Currently, there are four Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 12936 (N16W35) was the source of one M-class flare and associated C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-29T23:36Z. It will likely continue to show activity as it rotates towards the western limb of the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 12939 (S15E62) and 12940 (N22E46) have been sources of C-class flaring throughout the reporting period and may continue to exhibit B and C-class flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Active Region 12938 (N18W20) has been relatively quiet throughout the reporting period, but may increase in activity during the outlook period. Active Region 12937 (S20W81) has decayed to a plage and will rotate off the Earth-facing disk on or around 2022-02-03. There are a few unnumbered active regions seen towards the eastern limb in STEREO A EUVI 195 that will likely rotate onto the Earth-facing disk on or around 2022-02-03.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period.  The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES has been elevated due to lingering effects of the previously mentioned arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-01-28 (see notification 20220202-AL-002). Towards the end of the reporting period, geomagnetic activity was slightly elevated due to the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-02-01T21:37Z that is likely associated with the arrival of the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-29T23:36Z. An equatorial coronal hole centered on the Earth-facing meridian on 2022-02-02 may reach geoeffective longitudes on 2022-02-05. Additionally, a coronal hole observed in SDO AIA imagery near S30E15 on 2022-02-02 may become geoeffective on or around 2022-02-06. \n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20220202-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/19046/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-02-02T17:18Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-02-02T17:18:02Z\n## Message ID: 20220202-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A and STEREO B. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2022-01-31T21:42Z and 2022-02-01T22:59Z (average arrival 2022-02-01T09:26Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2022-02-01T00:02Z and 2022-02-02T00:57Z (average arrival 2022-02-01T11:51Z) for 93% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-01-31T20:57Z and 2022-02-02T02:10Z (average arrival 2022-02-01T09:07Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 64% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_STA_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThe initial non-ensemble simulation also predicted an arrival at Solar Orbiter (see previous notification 20220130-AL-001).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set.
