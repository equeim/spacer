This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at minor levels during this reporting period.  There were 8 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the following CMEs were predicted to impact:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2022-10-19T11:00Z    OSIRIS-REx at 2022-10-22T10:34Z (notification 20221020-AL-003)\n2022-10-19T23:24Z    OSIRIS-REx at 2022-10-22T10:34Z (notification 20221020-AL-003)\n2022-10-21T02:48Z    OSIRIS-REx at 2022-10-23T22:11Z\n2022-10-22T06:12Z    OSIRIS-REx at 2022-10-25T04:14Z\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods 2022-10-22T09:00Z-12:00Z and 2022-10-22T15:00Z to 2022-10-22T21:00Z. This elevated value of Kp may have been associated with the potential arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-10-22 with the associated interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-10-22T07:30Z (see notification 20221022-AL-001). The maximum sustained solar wind speed observed by DSCOVR at L1 reached approximately 595 km/s. Currently, the solar wind speed is around 350 km/s. STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments detected an interplanetary shock at 2022-10-20T23:22Z that may have also been associated with the previously mentioned coronal hole high speed stream.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was already elevated but below the threshold of 1000 pfu at the beginning of this reporting period (on 2022-10-19) due to a coronal hole high speed stream in the previous reporting period detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-10-14. On 2022-10-20T13:50Z, the energetic electron flux crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu again (see notifications 20221020-AL-001 and 20221020-AL-002). These elevated electron flux levels were likely caused by the lingering effects of the above mentioned coronal hole high speed stream. The energetic electron flux levels decreased to background levels late on 2022-10-21.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the effects of the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)\n2022-10-19T08:12Z     ~540            C               NONE/56               20                          SOHO\n2022-10-19T11:00Z     ~623            C               112/13                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-10-19T23:24Z     ~760            C               104/17                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-10-21T02:48Z     ~593            C                87/13                26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-10-21T07:12Z     ~532            C                92/16                26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-10-22T02:12Z     ~514            C              -144/-47               13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-10-22T06:12Z     ~593            C                97/28                29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-10-25T10:07Z     ~766            C              -107/11                17                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-10-26T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-11-01T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at minor to moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently 5 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13126 (S10W70) was the source of B-class and C-class level flaring during the reporting period. Newly numbered Active Region 13133 (N25E65) has been the source of recent C-class flaring and may continue to exhibit flaring activity throughout the outlook period. An unnumbered Active Region is visible on the STEREO A facing eastern limb around latitude N25 and may be expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk on or around 2022-10-28.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There is a small coronal hole centered around N25W25 that may become geoeffective around 2022-10-27. A coronal hole centered around N05E10 may become geoeffective around 2022-10-30.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20221022-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22077/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-10-22T12:36Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-10-22T12:36:12Z\n## Message ID: 20221022-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Currently, the solar wind speed is just under 450 km/s. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was elevated above the threshold level of 1000 pfu early in the reporting period until 2022-10-13 due to an initial threshold crossing in the previous reporting period beginning at 2022-10-05T14:40Z (see notification 20221013-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor this week due to the waning effects of the RBE described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-10-12  23:54:00  00:37:00  00:19:00   M1.5   N25W65 ( 13112 ) \n2022-10-14  09:51:00  09:59:00  09:55:00   M1.3   N22W88 ( 13112 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-10-14T12:12Z     ~502            C              -121/54                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-10-17T04:36Z     ~542            C                73/1                 28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-10-19T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-10-25T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at minor levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently four numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk.  The most notable of these, Active Region 13124 (S34W68), has produced only C-class flaring and should rotate off the Earth-facing disk by 2022-10-21.  An unnumbered Active Region near N20E95 is visible on the STEREO A eastern limb and just over the SDO eastern limb, may be expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2022-10-20, and may produce some activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt is currently elevated but below the threshold level of 1000 pfu, as a result of the coronal hole high speed stream first detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-10-14, and may remain elevated through the beginning of the outlook period. There is a large coronal hole centered near S35E35 that may begin crossing the Earth-facing central meridian on 2022-10-20 and may reach geoeffective longitudes by 2022-10-24. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20221017-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22032/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-10-17T18:27Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-REx)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-10-17T18:27:36Z\n## Message ID: 20221017-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest values of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods 2022-10-02T21:00Z to 2022-10-03T00:00Z and 2022-10-03T18:00Z-21:00Z. These elevated values of Kp were likely associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream first detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-10-03 (see notification 20221003-AL-002), possibly combined with the arrival of one or two small transients. The maximum solar wind speed observed by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 reached values of 605 km/s. Currently, the solar wind speed has values around 520 km/s. STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments detected an interplanetary shock on 2022-09-29 that may also have been associated with the above mentioned coronal hole high speed stream. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A remained below their respective thresholds for the entire reporting period. Following its minor elevation in the previous reporting period, the energetic proton fluxes at GOES, SOHO and STEREO A returned to background levels by 2022-09-30. In the last four days of the reporting period the proton fluxes at GOES and SOHO had periodical slight increases to above nominal (but still below threshold) levels due to the high flaring and CME activity on the last four days.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to minor this week due to the somewhat elevated energetic proton fluxes mentioned above. \n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-09-30  03:46:00  06:51:00  04:01:00   M1.0   N25E88 ( 13112 ) \n2022-09-30  16:11:00  16:33:00  16:22:00   M2.9   N25E87 ( 13112 ) \n2022-09-30  17:30:00  17:45:00  17:34:00   M1.3   N25E87 ( 13112 ) \n2022-10-01  19:58:00  20:16:00  20:10:00   M5.8   N17W35 ( 13110 ) \n2022-10-02  02:08:00  02:26:00  02:21:00   M8.7   N17W39 ( 13110 ) \n2022-10-02  13:52:00  14:23:00  14:05:00   M1.2   N22E70 ( 13112 ) \n2022-10-02  15:34:00  15:53:00  15:45:00   M1.0   N22E67 ( 13112 ) \n2022-10-02  19:53:00  20:34:00  20:25:00   X1.0   N17W49 ( 13110 ) \n2022-10-03  02:19:00  03:02:00  02:33:00   M2.6   N23E63 ( 13112 ) \n2022-10-03  09:38:00  10:27:00  10:11:00   M4.2   N17W57 ( 13110 ) \n2022-10-03  11:03:00  11:19:00  11:11:00   M1.5   N17W58 ( 13110 ) \n2022-10-03  15:20:00  15:40:00  15:30:00   M1.6   N23E50 ( 13112 ) \n2022-10-03  19:57:00  20:52:00  20:28:00   M1.2   N17W64 ( 13110 ) \n2022-10-03  21:11:00  21:31:00  21:22:00   M1.7   N17W64 ( 13110 ) \n2022-10-04  12:48:00  13:51:00  13:15:00   M1.6   N17W75 ( 13110 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-09-28T04:48Z     ~1085           O               -30/10                22                          SOHO                                       \n2022-10-01T13:09Z     ~671            C                28/5                 40                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-10-04T14:24Z     ~797            C                -4/-30               39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-09-29T05:48Z     ~550            C                30/40               10                          SOHO          \n2022-09-30T05:23Z     ~712            C                NONE/-5             23                          STEREO A                         \n2022-09-30T18:38Z     ~541            C                82/1                23                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-09-30T21:36Z     ~674            C               -32/43               10                          SOHO                              \n2022-09-30T22:36Z     ~905            C                90/-8               20                          SOHO                              \n2022-10-01T03:23Z     ~675            C                31/16               13                          STEREO A, SOHO  \n2022-10-01T12:24Z     ~826            C                61/5                14                          SOHO, STEREO A                          \n2022-10-02T02:36Z     ~780            C                37/24               23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-10-02T15:05Z     ~591            C               126/12               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-10-02T20:36Z     ~1192           O                49/34               29                          SOHO                              \n2022-10-03T09:48Z     ~519            C                58/26               33                          SOHO                              \n2022-10-03T20:36Z     ~877            C                65/44               25                          SOHO                              \n2022-10-04T13:36Z     ~1090           O                78/42               34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-10-05T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-10-11T23:59\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently 6 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. The most magnetically complex of these, Active Region 13112, has produced seven M-class flares and is expected to remain active during the outlook period, as it traverses the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13110, currently on the west limb, has produced one X-class  and seven M-class flares and multiple CMEs and is likely to continue its activity while it is rotating behind the limb. At least two unnumbered Active Regions currently rotating onto the STEREO A-facing disk (at around N30 and S20) may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk in the first half of the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels in the outlook period. Following the arrival of the above mentioned coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2022-10-03, the solar wind speed remains elevated at around 520 km/s and the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES exceeded the threshold beginning 2022-10-05T14:40Z (see notifications 20221005-AL-002 and 20221005-AL-003). We may expect some additional geomagnetic activity at NASA missions near Earth around 2022-10-06 due to a glancing blow from a S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-10-03T00:36Z, and on 2022-10-07 due to the arrival at L1 of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-10-04T14:24Z. Additionally, two small coronal holes that reached the central meridian on 2022-10-05 (an equatorial coronal hole currently centered around S02W02 and a southern coronal hole centered around S40E20) may become geoeffective by 2022-10-09.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20221005-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21911/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-10-05T15:08Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-10-05T15:08:47Z\n## Message ID: 20221005-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A, STEREO B, and Mars. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2022-10-03T19:26Z and 2022-10-04T03:38Z (average arrival 2022-10-03T23:52Z) for 35% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2022-10-04T09:02Z and 2022-10-05T00:33Z (average arrival 2022-10-04T16:55Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2022-10-05T14:45Z and 2022-10-06T08:59Z (average arrival 2022-10-05T23:50Z) for 97% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-10-04T00:29Z and 2022-10-04T13:41Z (average arrival 2022-10-04T07:11Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 88% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-10-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151/20221001_130900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-10-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151/20221001_130900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-10-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151/20221001_130900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-10-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151/20221001_130900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-10-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151/20221001_130900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-10-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151/20221001_130900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151_Mars_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-10-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151/20221001_130900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-10-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151/20221001_130900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151_STA_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-10-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151/20221001_130900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-10-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151/20221001_130900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2022-10-01T13:09:00-CME-001) was not predicted to arrive at STEREO A in previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20221001-AL-002).\n\nThe initial non-ensemble model of this CME (2022-10-01T13:09:00-CME-001) included another CME (2022-10-01T12:24:00-CME-001) that is not expected to impact any missions.\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-10-01_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151/Detailed_results_20221001_130900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX151.txt\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"FLR","messageID":"20221002-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21836/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-10-02T12:05Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - M8.7 Flare\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-10-02T12:05:43Z\n## Message ID: 20221002-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Two CMEs (2022-09-30T18:38:00-CME-001 and 2022-09-30T22:36:00-CME-001) are expected to merge and their combined leading edge is expected to arrive at OSIRIS-REx, based on the simulation outputs.  The third CME (2022-10-01T03:23:00-CME-001) is expected to propagate through interplanetary space independent of the other two CMEs and is expected to arrive as a glancing blow at STEREO B, based on the simulation outputs.\n\nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"}]
