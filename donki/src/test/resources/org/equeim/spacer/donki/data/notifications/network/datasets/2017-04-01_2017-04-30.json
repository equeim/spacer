This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low to moderate levels during this reporting period.  There were 2 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period.  Geomagnetic Kp index has reached level 6 (moderate) during the synoptic periods of 2017-04-20T03:00Z-06:00Z, 2017-04-22T03:00Z-06:00Z, 2017-04-22T12:00Z-15:00Z, 2017-04-22T21:00Z-24:00Z, and 2017-04-23T06:00Z-09:00Z.  The enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with a couple of coronal hole high speed streams detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2017-04-18 and 2017-04-21, respectively.  The second one was possibly combined with a glancing blow of a transient that started on 2017-04-18T19:48Z.  Solar wind speeds reached very high values on 2017-04-23 with values of >750 km/s (see notifications 20170420-AL-001, 20170420-AL-002, 20170422-AL-001, 20170422-AL-002, 20170423-AL-001).  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-04-23T15:05Z. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the coronal hole high speed streams described above (see notification 20170423-AL-002 and 20170425-AL-001).  Fluxes are still currently elevated.  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV were at background levels for the entire reporting period.  \n\nThere was a solar energetic particle event detected by STEREO A.  The flux of 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2017-04-18T23:39Z.  This solar energetic particle event was associated with a C5.5 class-flare with from the active region 12651 and the CME that started 2017-04-18T19:48Z  (see notifications 20170419-AL-001 and 20170419-AL-002, and 20170419-AL-003).  \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the due to the solar energetic particle event detected by STEREO A and the elevation in the electron fluxes at the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-04-20T22:09Z     ~719            C               -10/34                34                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-04-23T06:00Z     ~911            C               -66/-3                23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-04-26T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-05-02T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  The active regions on the Earth's facing side of the solar disk are currently producing low classification solar flares and coronal mass ejections.   Geomagnetic activity was elevated during the reporting period, but it is expected to go back to nominal levels in the next few days.   \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There were 3 C-type CMEs (see details below).   Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it was estimated that the CME starting on 2017-04-18T19:48Z may impact Spitzer at 2017-04-21T02:26Z, Mars at 2017-04-23T18:00Z (glancing blow), and STEREO A at 2017-04-21T20:00Z (glancing blow) (plus minus 7 hours). This CME event is associated with a C5.5 flare starting on 2017-04-18T19:15Z from solar active region 12651 (see notification 20170419-AL-003). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.   An arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream was detected by DSCOVR/ACE around 2017-04-18. The arrival elevated the geomagnetic activity to a Kp=5 for the synoptic period of 2017-04-19T03:00Z-06:00Z.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nSolar energetic particle event was detected by STEREO A. The flux of 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2017-04-18T23:39Z.  This event was associated with the C5.5. flare from active region 12651 and the CME starting at 2017-04-18T19:48Z described above (see notifications 20170419-AL-001 and 20170419-AL-002).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES was at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the solar energetic particle event detected by STEREO A described above.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-04-12T13:26Z     ~661            C              -149/6                 35                          SOHO                              \n2017-04-18T10:00Z     ~512            C               -78/-3                16                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2017-04-18T19:48Z     ~934            C               -76/21                50                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-04-19T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-04-25T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  The active region 12651, which is just rotating to the Earth's facing side, is currently producing solar flares and coronal mass ejections.   Geomagnetic activity was slightly elevated on 2017-04-19 due to the arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream described above.  The geomagnetic activity will enhance within the next several days due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream located near the center disk.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2017-04-09T03:00Z-06:00Z.  This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with a coronal hole high speed solar wind stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2017-04-07.  Solar wind speed reached values of >600 km/s on 2017-04-08.\n\nOn 2017-04-06 the STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream.  The solar wind speed reached values of >600 km/s by 2017-04-07.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. They have been slightly elevated by 2017-04-12 to values of about 60,000 pfu possibly due to the coronal hole high speed stream described above.  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-04-11T11:24Z     ~693            C               146/23                11                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-04-12T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-04-18T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  The active regions on the Earth's facing side have low magnetic complexity, but the previous active region 12644 which is now visible from the STA EUVI images has been continuously active and has the capability to produce solar flares and coronal mass ejections.   Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream near the center disk.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

The slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity on 2017-04-04 was possibly associated with the glancing blow of a transient arriving on the same day associated with the M4.4 class-flare from active region 12644 on 2017-04-01 with a possible combination with a small coronal hole high speed stream.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained above the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for almost the entire reporting period starting on 2017-03-28 due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2017-03-27 (see notifications 20170328-AL-001, 20170328-AL-002, 20170330-AL-001, 20170401-AL-001, and 20170403-AL-001).
