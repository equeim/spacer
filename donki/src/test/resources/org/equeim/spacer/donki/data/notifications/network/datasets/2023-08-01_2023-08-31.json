There are currently six numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13415 (currently located at S10W30) and Active Region 13417 (currently located at S07E50) each produced an M-class flare during the reporting period and may exhibit increased flaring activity during the outlook period. As seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO, there are currently two unnumbered Active Regions visible near the eastern limb around latitudes N22 and S20 which might also exhibit flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A coronal hole currently centered around N30W24 (as seen in SDO EUV imagery) crossed the central meridian on 2023-08-28 and may become geoeffective on or around 2023-08-31. Additional coronal hole structures currently visible in SDO EUV imagery around N43E20 and S40E35 may develop further and become geoeffective towards the end of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230827-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/26649/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-08-27T15:59Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Lucy, Mars)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-08-27T15:59:56Z\n## Message ID: 20230827-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There are several active regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13405 (N09W41), which recently produced an M1.1 flare on 2023-08-22, may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity during the beginning of the outlook period. Additional flaring activity may be seen from recently numbered Active Regions 13413 (N09E52) and 13415 (S09E66) as they traverse the Earth-facing disk.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period. Increased geomagnetic activity may be observed around 2023-08-26 in association with the predicted arrival of a C-type CME first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-08-22T23:29Z (see notification 20230823-AL-001). Additionally, a small coronal hole currently visible near the central meridian of the Earth-facing disk near latitude S08 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO) may reach geoeffective longitudes on or around 2023-08-27. \n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230823-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/26609/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-08-23T20:52Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-REx, Parker Solar Probe, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-08-23T20:52:39Z\n## Message ID: 20230823-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

These elevated energetic electron flux levels are likely associated with the arrival of the C-type CME which was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 during the previous reporting period at 2023-08-02T09:12Z. The combined arrival of the CMEs detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-08-07T11:07Z may have further enhanced the electron fluxes during this reporting period (see notifications 20230811-AL-002, 20230813-AL-001, and 20230815-AL-001).\n\nA solar energetic particle event previously observed by SOHO on 2023-08-07 and by GOES and STEREO A on 2023-08-08 persisted through the beginning of the reporting period. At SOHO, one or more of the >15.8 MeV channels were above the 10^1 pfu/MeV threshold, subsiding below 10^-1 pfu/MeV on 2023-08-10 (see notification 20230807-AL-005). At GOES, the energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons was above the 10 pfu threshold, subsiding below 10 pfu on 2023-08-10 (see notifications 20230808-AL-002 and 20230808-AL-003). At STEREO A, the 13-100 MeV protons were above the 10^-1 pfu/MeV threshold, subsiding below 10^-1 pfu/MeV on 2023-08-10 (see notifications 20230808-AL-004, 20230808-AL-005, and 20230809-AL-001). During the remainder of the reporting period, the particle environment gradually returned to background levels at all locations.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle event detected at SOHO, GOES, and STEREO A, and the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-08-09T16:12Z     ~1103           O               125/-36               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-09T16:36Z     ~784            C               125/-7                42                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-10T02:48Z     ~625            C                80/-24               36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-10T05:48Z     ~543            C               -20/-63               30                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-08-10T12:00Z     ~590            C         NONE(POS)/21                28                          SOHO, STEREO A    \n2023-08-10T16:00Z     ~537            C              -166/-12               39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-11T06:36Z     ~751            C               -90/3                 32                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-08-11T13:48Z     ~517            C         NONE(POS)/-3                19                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-08-13T16:09Z     ~515            C         NONE(POS)/-13               31                          SOHO, STEREO A       \n2023-08-14T20:48Z     ~518            C               -90/19                45                          SOHO                              \n2023-08-15T13:36Z     ~540            C                90/-38               33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-08-16T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date: 2023-08-22T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently nine numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13405 (N10E55) produced many C-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to produce flaring activity during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Coronal hole structures currently visible on the Earth-facing disk around N35W50 and S15W40 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO) may become geoeffective during the beginning of the outlook period between 2023-08-16 to 2023-08-18. Additionally, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt remains elevated above background levels (see notification 20230815-AL-001) and this elevation may persist into the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20230815-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/26508/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-08-15T17:18Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-08-15T17:18:53Z\n## Message ID: 20230815-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp=6.67 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-08-05T03:00Z-06:00Z. This was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-08-05T02:10Z which was associated with the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-08-02T09:12Z (see notification 20230805-AL-004).

At SOHO, the flux of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-08-05T10:19Z and the flux of the 28.2-50.1 protons channel exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV at 2023-08-05T10:47Z (see notification 20230805-AL-006). At GOES, the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2023-08-05T11:15Z (see notifications 20230805-AL-003 and 20230805-AL-006). This solar energetic particle event was associated with an M1.6 flare which peaked at 2023-08-05T07:20Z and subsequent O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-08-05T07:12Z and may have been further enhanced by the X1.6 class flare peaking at 2023-08-05T22:21Z and subsequent O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-08-05T22:24Z.\n\nThe second solar energetic particle event was detected by SOHO, GOES, and STEREO A. At SOHO, the flux of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-08-07T22:09Z and the flux of the 28.2-50.1 protons channel exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV at 2023-08-07T22:19Z (see notification 20230807-AL-005).

At STEREO A, the flux of 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 10^-1 pfu/MeV at 2023-08-08T04:26Z (see notifications 20230808-AL-004 and 20230808-AL-005). This solar energetic particle event was associated with an X1.5 flare which peaked at 2023-08-07T20:46Z and subsequent O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-08-07T20:48Z.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle events detected at SOHO, GOES and STEREO A described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-08-02  08:03:00  08:21:00  08:12:00   M1.3   N11W22 ( 13386 ) \n2023-08-02  10:44:00  10:54:00  10:50:00   M1.2   S10W61 ( 13380 ) \n2023-08-02  14:46:00  14:56:00  14:52:00   M1.7   S10W63 ( 13380 ) \n2023-08-02  16:13:00  16:26:00  16:22:00   M1.3   S10W63 ( 13380 ) \n2023-08-02  19:09:00  19:21:00  19:14:00   M1.1   S10W66 ( 13380 ) \n2023-08-03  11:47:00  11:59:00  11:55:00   M2.0   S10W72 ( 13380 ) \n2023-08-04  03:38:00  05:11:00  04:24:00   M1.9   N12W47 ( 13386 ) \n2023-08-05  06:18:00  09:06:00  07:22:00   M1.6   N11W65 ( 13386 ) \n2023-08-05  09:23:00  09:50:00  09:36:00   M2.1   S11W98 ( 13380 ) \n2023-08-05  21:45:00  22:44:00  22:21:00   X1.6   N11W74 ( 13386 ) \n2023-08-06  18:20:00  18:54:00  18:40:00   M5.5   N11W89 ( 13386 ) \n2023-08-07  04:29:00  04:51:00  04:41:00   M2.4   N10W93 ( 13386 ) \n2023-08-07  15:30:00  16:24:00  16:11:00   M1.0   N16W81 ( 13387 ) \n2023-08-07  16:24:00  16:36:00  16:26:00   M1.0   N14W87 ( 13387 ) \n2023-08-07  19:37:00  19:58:00  19:51:00   M1.4   N19W75 ( 13387 ) \n2023-08-07  20:30:00  21:18:00  20:46:00   X1.5   N11W90 ( 13386 ) \n2023-08-08  09:20:00  09:41:00  09:31:00   M3.6   N18W78 ( 13387 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-08-02T09:12Z     ~759            C                26/-4                42                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-04T04:17Z     ~865            C                47/13                41                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-04T04:49Z     ~543            C                45/9                 37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-05T07:12Z     ~1044           O                63/-17               46                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-05T22:24Z     ~1757           O                75/23                49                          SOHO                              \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-08-06T04:00Z     ~747            C             NONE(POS)/-1            25                          SOHO, STEREO A \n2023-08-06T18:48Z     ~1260           O                90/-15               35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-07T05:00Z     ~620            C                95/-9                29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-07T15:09Z     ~608            C                75/-2                17                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-08-07T16:09Z     ~680            C                75/-2                23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-07T16:39Z     ~522            C                75/-2                19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-07T20:48Z     ~1429           O               100/4                 45                          SOHO\n2023-08-08T12:00Z     ~648            C             NONE(POS)/-21           15                          SOHO, STEREO A                             \n2023-08-08T18:24Z     ~536            C             NONE(POS)/20            17                          SOHO, STEREO A\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-08-09T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-08-15T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between moderate and high levels during the outlook period. The SEP event at STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES which started on 2023-08-07 is still ongoing. There are currently seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13386 produced the majority of the M-class flares and the two X-class flares during the reporting period before rotating off the Earth-facing disk around 2023-08-07, and may continue to produce notable activity from beyond the limb. In addition, Active Region 13387 rotated off of the Earth-facing disk around 2023-08-09 and may continue to produce notable activity.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt recently crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-08-09T15:20Z and is most likely associated with the arrival of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-08-02T09:12Z that was detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-08-05T02:10Z (see notifications 20230809-AL-002 and 20230809-AL-003). The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux may continue to be elevated throughout the outlook period. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20230809-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/26440/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-08-09T15:40Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-08-09T15:40:36Z\n## Message ID: 20230809-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\nSTEREO A between about 2023-08-06T17:52Z and 2023-08-07T07:49Z (average arrival 2023-08-07T02:16Z) for 95% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CMEs is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-08-06T21:30Z and 2023-08-07T13:36Z (average arrival 2023-08-07T06:15Z) for 100% of simulations.

This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

Analysis of these events is currently ongoing.\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs would impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-07-27T21:36Z   Mars at 2023-08-02T02:40Z and Lucy at 2023-08-04T03:35Z\n2023-07-28T15:53Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-07-30T20:00Z (minor impact) and Juno at 2023-08-12T12:00Z (glancing blow) (see notifications 20230728-AL-002, 20230728-AL-004 and 20230728-AL-005)\n2023-07-28T22:36Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-07-31T03:54Z, STEREO A at 2023-07-31T19:15Z, and OSIRIS-REx at 2023-08-01T13:41Z (see notifications  20230729-AL-003 and 20230729-AL-006)\n2023-07-29T07:53Z   Mars at 2023-08-04T14:00Z (glancing blow)\n2023-07-31T23:36Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-08-03T14:36Z, STEREO A at 2023-08-04T00:01Z, and OSIRIS-REx at 2023-08-05T02:42Z (see notification 20230801-AL-002)\n2023-08-01T00:12Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-08-03T14:36Z, STEREO A at 2023-08-04T00:01Z, and OSIRIS-REx at 2023-08-05T02:42Z (see notification 20230801-AL-002)\n2023-08-01T12:36Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-08-03T16:00Z (minor impact), STEREO A at 2023-08-04T20:00Z (glancing blow), and OSIRIS-REx at 2023-08-05T16:00Z (minor impact) (see notification 20230802-AL-001)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4.67 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4.67 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-07-26T03:00Z-06:00Z. This minor enhancement of geomagnetic activity was caused by the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-07-25T21:54Z (see notification 20230726-AL-001) which was associated with the arrival of the O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO imagery at 2023-07-23T15:05Z (see notifications 20230723-AL-001 and 20230724-AL-003) from the previous reporting period. The arrival of this CME may have also been detected by STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments around 2023-07-25T19:00Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt initially crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-07-29T14:45Z and has remained elevated throughout the reporting period (see notifications 20230729-AL-004, 20230729-AL-005, and 20230731-AL-001). These elevated energetic electron flux levels are likely associated with the arrival of the O-type CME mentioned above which was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 during the previous reporting period at 2023-07-25T21:54Z.\n\nAdditionally, there was a solar energetic particle event detected by SOHO, GOES, and STEREO A. At SOHO, the flux of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-07-28T19:19Z and the flux of the 28.2-50.1 protons channel exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-07-28T19:23Z (see notification 20230728-AL-003).  At GOES, the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2023-07-28T23:50Z (see notifications 20230728-AL-006 and 20230729-AL-002). Finally, the flux of 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-07-29T00:53Z (see notifications 20230729-AL-001, 20230729-AL-002 and 20230730-AL-001). This solar energetic particle event was associated with an M4.1 flare which peaked at 2023-07-28T15:58Z and subsequent R-type CME first visible in STEREO A coronagraph imagery at 2023-07-28T15:53Z (see notifications 20230728-AL-002, 20230728-AL-004, and 20230728-AL-005). The particle environment has returned to background levels at all locations. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle events detected at SOHO, GOES and STEREO A, and the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-07-26  04:21:00  04:33:00  04:28:00   M1.2   N23W68 ( 13376 ) \n2023-07-26  10:17:00  10:48:00  10:37:00   M4.6   N23W74 ( 13376 ) \n2023-07-26  15:50:00  16:07:00  15:59:00   M2.0   N23W77 ( 13376 ) \n2023-07-26  16:10:00  16:17:00  16:13:00   M1.1   N23W77 ( 13376 ) \n2023-07-27  09:44:00  09:58:00  09:51:00   M1.9   N23W90 ( 13376 ) \n2023-07-27  22:04:00  23:05:00  22:34:00   M1.7   S25E75 ( 13388 ) \n2023-07-28  15:39:00  16:13:00  15:58:00   M4.1   N25W99 ( 13376 ) \n2023-07-29  16:11:00  16:37:00  16:24:00   M1.4   S10W10 ( 13380 ) \n2023-07-30  08:01:00  08:18:00  08:14:00   M1.8   S18E57 ( 13390 ) \n2023-07-30  08:18:00  08:26:00  08:22:00   M1.8   S18E57 ( 13390 ) \n2023-07-31  08:42:00  09:13:00  09:00:00   M1.6   S20E43 ( 13390 ) \n2023-08-01  01:38:00  01:58:00  01:56:00   M1.0   S10W40 ( 13380 ) \n2023-08-01  01:58:00  02:07:00  02:03:00   M1.2   S10W40 ( 13380 ) \n2023-08-01  04:27:00  05:07:00  04:47:00   M2.2   S10W45 ( 13380 ) \n2023-08-01  05:30:00  05:43:00  05:37:00   M1.3   S10W45 ( 13380 ) \n2023-08-01  06:28:00  07:19:00  06:57:00   M3.6   S10W47 ( 13380 ) \n2023-08-01  09:03:00  09:16:00  09:09:00   M1.5   S08W42 ( 13380 ) \n2023-08-01  14:03:00  14:27:00  14:09:00   M1.4   S10W47 ( 13380 ) \n2023-08-01  21:39:00  21:58:00  21:51:00   M1.0   S10W51 ( 13380 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-07-28T22:36Z     ~589            C               -27/-3                42                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-07-31T23:36Z     ~636            C               -23/10                19                          SOHO                              \n2023-08-01T00:12Z     ~564            C               -32/5                 37                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-07-27T21:36Z     ~680            C              -110/16                51                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-07-27T23:24Z     ~590            C               -75/-25               31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-07-28T15:53Z     ~2000           R               110/40                43                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-07-29T07:53Z     ~526            C               -88/9                 32                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-07-30T17:12Z     ~549            C                99/-52               31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-01T12:36Z     ~1369           O                22/17                11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-08-02T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-08-08T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between moderate and high levels during the outlook period. There are currently eight numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13380 (currently located at S10W64) produced the majority of M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to produce notable activity before rotating off the Earth-facing disk around 2023-08-05. Additionally, there is at least one unnumbered Active Region visible near the eastern limb in SDO imagery located around latitude S22 which may exhibit flaring activity throughout the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Increased geomagnetic activity may be observed on or around 2023-08-04 with the anticipated arrivals of several Earth directed CMEs observed during the reporting period (as previously summarized above). Additionally, a continued enhancement in the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux is possible during the first half of the outlook period due to the recent arrival of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO at 2023-07-28T22:36Z that was detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-08-01T10:08Z (see notification 20230801-AL-001).\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230802-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/26301/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-08-02T16:28Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-REx, Parker Solar Probe, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-08-02T16:28:15Z\n## Message ID: 20230802-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
