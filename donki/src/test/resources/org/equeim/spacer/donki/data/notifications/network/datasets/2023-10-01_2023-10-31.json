There were 15 C-type CMEs and one O-type CME (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the C-type CME first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-10-18T06:12Z may give a glancing blow to NASA missions Near Earth around 2023-10-22T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum Kp index of 2-3 (below minor) (see notification 20231018-AL-001). The arrival of this CME was not detected at L1.\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs would impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-10-18T06:12Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-10-19T15:00Z (minor impact) and OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-10-21T15:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20231018-AL-001)\n2023-10-19T15:36Z   Lucy at 2023-10-27T02:39Z and Mars at 2023-10-24T03:10Z (see notification 20231019-AL-001)\n2023-10-22T02:16Z   Lucy at 2023-10-27T14:00Z (glancing blow)\n2023-10-22T22:25Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-10-25T10:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20231023-AL-001)\n2023-10-24T17:53Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-10-26T18:29Z (see notifications 20231024-AL-001 and 20231025-AL-001)\n2023-10-24T20:48Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-10-27T03:14Z (see notification 20231025-AL-002)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-10-21T06:00Z-09:00Z. This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-10-20T07:30Z which may have been associated with the weak arrival of the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-10-16T12:09Z during the previous reporting period. This arrival may have also been detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data around 2023-10-20T07:50Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed.\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-10-18T06:12Z     ~543            C               -37/-33               29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)                    \n2023-10-18T03:36Z     ~794            C              -100/-14               14                          SOHO                              \n2023-10-19T01:48Z     ~663            C                94/37                45                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-10-19T07:00Z     ~1134           O          NONE(POS)/18               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                     \n2023-10-19T07:12Z     ~717            C               130/17                12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-19T15:36Z     ~785            C              -167/-18               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-21T08:30Z     ~570            C                90/-55               13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-21T09:09Z     ~536            C                90/-50               17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-22T02:16Z     ~683            C               150/-7                26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-22T17:52Z     ~503            C          NONE(POS)/14               19                          SOHO, STEREO A  \n2023-10-22T22:25Z     ~520            C              -120/60                49                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-22T23:56Z     ~709            C              -166/-82               36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-23T12:17Z     ~521            C               110/17                27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-24T11:12Z     ~683            C              -175/-81               26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-24T17:53Z     ~763            C              -117/18                34                          STEREO A, SOHO\n2023-10-24T20:48Z     ~529            C              -95/-3                 19                          SOHO, STEREO A \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-10-25T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-10-31T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at low levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently two numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13468 (currently located around S10W48) produced low level C-class flaring throughout the reporting period and may continue to exhibit flaring activity before rotating off the Earth-facing disk on or around 2023-10-29.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A small coronal hole currently centered around N10W40 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO) may reach geoeffective longitudes on or around 2023-10-27. A coronal hole currently centered around longitude E30 and extending from latitudes S10 to N40 may reach a geoeffective longitude towards the end of the reporting period on or around 2023-10-31.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20231025-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/27466/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-10-25T21:13Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Parker Solar Probe)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-10-25T21:13:08Z\n## Message ID: 20231025-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There are currently three numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13464 (currently located at N04W42) exhibited C-class flaring throughout the reporting period and may continue to exhibit flaring activity before it rotates off the Earth-facing disk around 2023-10-22. Additional flaring activity may occur throughout the outlook period from an unnumbered region currently visible in SDO imagery around N25E60.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and below minor levels during the outlook period. A slight increase in geomagnetic activity may be observed around 2023-10-19 in association with the predicted arrival of a C-type CME first observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2023-10-16T12:09Z (see notifications 20231016-AL-002, 20231017-AL-001, and 20231017-AL-002) as previously summarized above. Additionally, a small coronal hole currently centered around N45W20 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO) may reach geoeffective longitudes on or around 2023-10-22. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20231018-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/27373/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-10-18T18:22Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Solar Orbiter, OSIRIS, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-10-18T18:22:30Z\n## Message ID: 20231018-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 66% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-10-16_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA048/20231016_120900_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA048_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-10-16_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA048/20231016_120900_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA048_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-10-16_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA048/20231016_120900_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA048_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-10-16_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA048/20231016_120900_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA048_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-10-16_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA048/20231016_120900_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA048_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2023-10-16T12:09:00-CME-001) is also predicted to have an impact at OSIRIS at 2023-10-19T08:15Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2023-10-18T01:10Z, and Solar Orbiter at 2023-10-17T08:26Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notifications 20231016-AL-002 and 20231017-AL-001).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-10-16_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA048/Detailed_results_20231016_120900_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA048.txt\n###\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20231017-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/27333/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-10-17T19:08Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (OSIRIS, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-10-17T19:08:04Z\n## Message ID: 20231017-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
