Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2022-09-30T09:13Z and 2022-09-30T16:54Z (average arrival 2022-09-30T12:36Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-09-30T21:49Z and 2022-10-01T05:11Z (average arrival 2022-10-01T00:32Z) for 75% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 100% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-30_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150/20220928_044800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-30_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150/20220928_044800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-30_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150/20220928_044800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-30_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150/20220928_044800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-30_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150/20220928_044800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-30_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150/20220928_044800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2022-09-28T04:48:00-CME-001) was also predicted to impact Parker Solar Probe at 2022-09-29T10:49Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20220929-AL-001).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-30_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150/Detailed_results_20220928_044800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX150.txt\n\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20220930-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21803/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-09-30T11:49Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-09-30T11:49:03Z\n## Message ID: 20220930-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp = 6 occurred during the synoptic period 2022-09-27T00:00Z-03:00Z (see notifications 20220927-AL-001 and 20220927-AL-003). This moderate geomagnetic storm was associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream first detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-09-27 (see notification 20220927-AL-002). The maximum solar wind speed observed by ACE at L1 reached values of 737 km/s. Currently, the solar wind speed has values around 500 km/s. STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments detected the coronal hole high speed stream mentioned above on 2022-09-24. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2022-09-25T12:35Z. The energetic electron flux levels may have been caused by a weak coronal hole high speed stream that was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-09-23 with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-09-22T20:57Z (see notifications 20220925-AL-001 and 20220925-AL-002). Energetic electron flux levels decreased to background levels late on 2022-09-26. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were elevated above background levels but remained below threshold levels throughout the reporting period. The cause of these elevated energetic proton fluxes in still under investigation. The energetic proton fluxes at GOES and STEREO A have been decreasing to near background levels towards the end of the reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic proton and electron fluxes mentioned above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-09-21  06:51:00  07:18:00  07:02:00   M1.0   S28E73 ( 13107 ) \n2022-09-23  17:48:00  18:30:00  18:10:00   M1.7   N16E80 ( 13110 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-09-22T21:12Z     ~1236           O               -90/9                 21                          SOHO                              \n2022-09-23T14:09Z     ~656            C                71/-7                41                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-09-23T18:23Z     ~1750           O               -88/3                 36                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-09-24T07:24Z     ~706            C               126/-39               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-09-24T17:53Z     ~1052           O               -66/11                32                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-09-26T09:36Z     ~772            C               -90/-29               34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-09-27T11:00Z     ~704            C               110/-4                32                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-09-28T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-10-04T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period.

Active Region 13105 has been producing C-class flares and it may continue to be active during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels for the outlook period. The solar wind speed remains elevated following the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2022-09-27. A small coronal hole located around N05W25 may become geoeffective starting on 2022-09-30.

This event is still under analysis. \n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2022-09-16T02:00Z    Mars at 2022-09-20T01:51Z, STEREO B at 2022-09-19T03:15Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-09-18T21:30Z (see notification 20220916-AL-003)\n2022-09-18T18:12Z    Mars at 2022-09-22T16:20Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-09-22T02:00Z, STEREO B at 2022-09-21T19:30Z (see notification 20220919-AL-001)\n2022-09-20T06:36Z    Mars at 2022-09-24T17:00Z\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 4 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-09-14T21:00Z to 2022-09-15T03:00Z.  This elevated value of Kp was likely associated with the arrival of the S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-09-09T07:24Z.  This arrival was associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2022-09-14T06:23Z (see notification 20220914-AL-001).\n\nThe >2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was enhanced early in the reporting period until 2022-09-14 due to a threshold crossing in a previous reporting period beginning at 2022-09-04T13:55Z. These elevated energetic electron flux levels were caused by a coronal hole high speed stream which arrived on 2022-09-03, reaching a maximum speed of approximately 687 km/s (see notification 20220914-AL-002). Energetic electron flux levels decreased to background levels by 2022-09-15 and remained at background levels for the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were elevated above background levels but remained below threshold levels throughout the reporting period.  These elevated energetic proton fluxes may have been associated with the far-sided halo O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-09-05T16:36Z and/or a S-type streamer blowout CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-09-08T08:48Z.  \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic proton and electron fluxes mentioned above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-09-14  09:41:00  10:43:00  10:19:00   M1.1   N20W58 (13098) \n2022-09-16  09:44:00  09:56:00  09:49:00   M7.9   N18W83 (13098) \n2022-09-16  15:49:00  16:12:00  15:59:00   M6.2   N18W85 (13098) \n2022-09-17  12:42:00  13:21:00  13:19:00   M1.0   N18W98 (13098) \n2022-09-17  13:21:00  13:53:00  13:39:00   M1.9   N18W98 (13098) \n2022-09-17  20:32:00  20:52:00  20:41:00   M2.6   N18W99 (13098) \n2022-09-20  11:13:00  11:34:00  11:22:00   M1.0   S26W19 (13102) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-09-16T02:00Z     ~732            C                55/-23               45                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-09-18T18:12Z     ~892            C                53/-31               34                          SOHO                              \n2022-09-20T03:12Z     ~515            C               -90/-24               10                          SOHO                              \n2022-09-20T06:36Z     ~513            C                43/-10               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-09-21T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-09-27T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate during the outlook period.  There are six numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk.  Active Region 13098 produced most of the M-class flaring activity during the reporting period but rotated off the Earth-facing disk on 2022-09-17.  Active Region 13102 produced one M-class flare on 2022-09-20, Active Region 13107 produced one M-class flare on 2022-09-21, and these two active regions may continue to remain active throughout the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate for the outlook period.  Solar wind speed remains elevated following the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2022-09-18.  Additionally, a large coronal hole centered around N05W25 may reach geoeffective longitudes starting on 2022-09-23.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220919-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21672/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-09-19T15:31Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Mars, OSIRIS-REx, STEREO B)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-09-19T15:31:25Z\n## Message ID: 20220919-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B and Mars. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO B between about 2022-09-18T16:38Z and 2022-09-19T06:18Z (average arrival 2022-09-19T00:40Z) for 56% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2022-09-19T16:50Z and 2022-09-20T12:15Z (average arrival 2022-09-20T03:41Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-09-18T19:23Z and 2022-09-18T21:31Z (average arrival 2022-09-18T20:03Z) for 8% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 66% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor to below minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-16_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149/20220916_020000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-16_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149/20220916_020000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-16_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149/20220916_020000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-16_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149/20220916_020000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-16_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149/20220916_020000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-16_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149/20220916_020000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149_Mars_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-16_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149/20220916_020000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-16_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149/20220916_020000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX149_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2022-09-16T02:00:00-CME-001) is also predicted to have an impact at OSIRIS-REx (glancing blow) at 2022-09-18T21:30Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20220916-AL-003).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set.

These elevated energetic electron flux levels were caused by the coronal hole high speed stream first detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-09-03.  The maximum solar wind speed observed at L1 reached values of roughly 687 km/s with current solar wind speeds around 300 km/s.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were elevated above background levels throughout the reporting period.  A solar energetic particle event was detected during the reporting period by SOHO.  The flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2022-09-12T08:46Z (see notification 20220912-AL-001).  The cause of this solar energetic particle event is still under analysis, but may be associated with a far-sided halo O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-09-05T16:36Z and/or a S-type streamer blowout CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-09-08T08:48Z.  \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the ongoing energetic electron flux enhancement and the elevated energetic proton fluxes mentioned above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-09-12  23:37:00  23:48:00  23:44:00   M1.7   N20W35 ( 13098 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s)\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-09-08T17:12Z     ~796            C               -76/-18               16                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-09-09T15:48Z     ~530            C               -20/53                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-09-14T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-09-20T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate during the outlook period.  There are six labeled Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk.  Active Region 13098 produced most of the flaring activity during the reporting period and may continue to show flaring activity as it rotates off the Earth-facing disk by 2022-09-18.  Newly numbered Active Region 13102 shows the most complex magnetic configuration and may show similar flaring activity as it traverses the Earth-facing disk.  On the STEREO A-facing disk, there are a few unnumbered Active Regions that may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk in the first half of the outlook period. The solar energetic particles detected at both SOHO and GOES are elevated but below their corresponding thresholds as of 2022-09-14. The cause of this elevation is still under analysis. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate for the outlook period.  A large coronal hole centered around N30W10 may reach geoeffective longitudes starting on 2022-09-18.  A second more diffuse coronal hole seen in the southern hemisphere may further enhance geomagnetic activity starting on 2022-09-19. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt currently remains elevated around or above 1000 pfu, as a result of the coronal hole high speed stream which arrived on 2022-09-03, and may remain elevated through the beginning of the outlook period with additional enhancement possible from the influence of an arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-09-14 of a S-type CME (see notification 20220914-AL-002).\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20220914-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21623/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-09-14T16:49Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-09-14T16:49:24Z\n## Message ID: 20220914-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

A coronal hole centered around S45E10 may become geoeffective by the end of the outlook period.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220907-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21565/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-09-07T11:57Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs update (Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-09-07T11:57:46Z\n## Message ID: 20220907-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 95% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-02_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147/20220902_193200_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-02_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147/20220902_193200_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-02_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147/20220902_193200_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-02_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147/20220902_193200_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-02_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147/20220902_193200_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-02_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147/20220902_193200_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\n\nThis CME event (2022-09-02T19:32:00-CME-001) is also predicted to have impacts at STEREO B (glancing blow) at 2022-09-05T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20220903-AL-001).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-09-02_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147/Detailed_results_20220902_193200_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX147.txt\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220903-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21519/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-09-03T04:48Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (STEREO A, STEREO B, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-09-03T04:48:54Z\n## Message ID: 20220903-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were 8 O-type CMEs and 10 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the O-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-08-27T02:23Z may affect Mars at 2022-08-29T19:52Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-28T21:14Z, STEREO B at 2022-08-29T06:29Z, Juno (glancing blow) at 2022-09-09T18:00Z, and NASA missions near Earth about 2022-08-29T11:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) with the roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index being 2-4 (see notification 20220827-AL-005). This CME event is associated with a M4.8 flare which peaked at 2022-08-27T02:40Z from Active Region 13088 (S29W62). Additionally, an ensemble simulation of this CME with 48 ensemble members was made (see notification 20220828-AL-001 and full details at https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146/Detailed_results_20220827_022300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146.txt). The arrival of this CME at L1 was likely detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-08-29T02:56Z (see notification 20220829-AL-001).\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2022-08-26T10:48Z    Solar Orbiter at 2022-08-28T11:30Z (see notification 20220827-AL-007)\n2022-08-26T13:48Z    Mars at 2022-08-31T04:59Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-29T00:18Z (see notification 20220826-AL-006)\n2022-08-28T16:23Z    OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-30T06:56Z and Mars at 2022-09-01T02:00Z (see notifications 20220828-AL-004 and 20220828-AL-005)\n2022-08-29T17:12Z    OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-31T21:08Z and Solar Orbiter at 2022-08-31T19:00Z (see notification 20220829-AL-004)\n2022-08-30T13:25Z    Solar Orbiter at 2022-09-01T12:23Z\n2022-08-30T18:24Z    Solar Orbiter at 2022-08-31T19:42Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2022-09-01T15:00Z (see notification 20220831-AL-001)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-08-27T09:00Z-15:00Z, 2022-08-29T03:00Z-06:00Z, and 2022-08-30T03:00-06:00Z. The slight increased of geomagnetic activity on 2022-08-27 may have been associated with the arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 of a coronal hole high speed stream that same day.  The latter increase on 2002-08-29 and 2022-08-30 may have been associated with the possible arrival of the CME first visible on 2022-08-27T02:23Z mentioned above (see notifications 20220827-AL-001, 20220829-AL-001, and 20220830-AL-001).\n\nSTEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments detected an interplanetary shock at 2022-08-25T08:04Z that may have been associated with the same coronal hole high speed stream described above. \n \nThe >2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was enhanced through the first part of the reporting period until 2022-08-27 due to a threshold crossing in the previous reporting period at 2022-08-19T12:40Z. These elevated energetic electron flux levels may have been caused by the combined arrival at L1 of a coronal hole high speed stream and two CMEs (see previous notifications (see notifications 20220814-AL-002, 20220814-AL-003, 20220815-AL-001, 20220816-AL-005, 20220817-AL-002).\n\nA solar energetic particle event was detected by SOHO and GOES during the reporting period. The flux of one or more of the SOHO >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2022-08-27T11:12Z, and the flux of the GOES >10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2022-08-27T11:55Z (see notifications 20220827-AL-002, 20220827-AL-003, and 20220827-AL-006). This solar energetic particle event was associated with the M4.8 flare from Active Region 13088 that peaked at 2022-08-27T02:40Z and the associated O-type CME first detected by STEREO A COR2A at 2022-08-27T02:23Z mentioned above. The energetic proton flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A was at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the solar energetic particle event described above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-08-25  19:39:00  20:02:00  19:51:00   M1.8   S25E65 ( 13089 )\n2022-08-25  23:21:00  23:32:00  23:27:00   M1.0   S24E61 ( 13089 )\n2022-08-26  10:41:00  11:05:00  10:55:00   M2.1   S24E50 ( 13089 ) \n2022-08-26  12:08:00  12:21:00  12:14:00   M7.2   S24E49 ( 13089 ) \n2022-08-26  12:24:00  12:38:00  12:31:00   M5.3   S24E49 ( 13089 ) \n2022-08-26  12:52:00  13:40:00  13:17:00   M3.6   S26W52 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-27  01:52:00  03:05:00  02:40:00   M4.8   S30W62 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-27  04:07:00  04:18:00  04:13:00   M1.3   S26W63 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-27  11:29:00  11:43:00  11:38:00   M1.2   S26W67 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-27  15:13:00  15:30:00  15:25:00   M1.1   S27W73 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-27  15:45:00  16:21:00  15:58:00   M1.8   S27W74 ( 13088 )\n2022-08-27  16:41:00  16:55:00  16:49:00   M1.1   S26W72 ( 13088 )\n2022-08-28  00:47:00  01:26:00  01:20:00   M1.4   S27W84 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-28  01:26:00  01:38:00  01:34:00   M1.4   S27W84 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-28  15:48:00  16:46:00  16:19:00   M6.7   S27W85 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-28  18:20:00  18:50:00  18:32:00   M4.6   S27W87 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-29  03:24:00  03:47:00  03:38:00   M3.3   S27W89 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-29  10:48:00  11:12:00  11:07:00   M8.6   S27W93 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-29  14:46:00  15:08:00  14:56:00   M2.5   S25W95 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-29  16:15:00  17:51:00  16:39:00   M3.8   S27W95 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-29  18:45:00  19:08:00  18:57:00   M4.7   S27W98 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-30  01:25:00  01:58:00  01:40:00   M1.6   S24W99 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-30  01:58:00  02:24:00  02:13:00   M1.5   S24W99 ( 13088 )\n2022-08-30  18:05:00  21:23:00  19:29:00   M2.1   S24W99 ( 13088 )\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-08-27T02:23Z     ~1372           O                56/-13               40                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-08-26T10:48Z     ~790            C               141/-27               28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-26T13:48Z     ~768            C                73/-16               38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-27T10:00Z     ~523            C                70/-33               11                          SOHO                              \n2022-08-28T16:23Z     ~1148           O                80/-8                37                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-08-29T06:24Z     ~880            C               -43/52                23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-29T07:36Z     ~774            C               -90/-30               11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-29T15:36Z     ~1149           O               114/-43               12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-29T17:12Z     ~949            C                97/-18               30                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-08-29T18:36Z     ~646            C                65/16                17                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-08-29T20:00Z     ~1154           O                NONE/-48             10                          SOHO\n2022-08-29T21:12Z     ~1409           O                NONE/-50             15                          SOHO\n2022-08-30T03:36Z     ~928            C                NONE/-41             10                          SOHO\n2022-08-30T06:12Z     ~1026           O                NONE/-43             14                          SOHO\n2022-08-30T12:36Z     ~637            C                151/-57              14                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-08-30T13:25Z     ~645            C                143/18               27                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-08-30T18:24Z     ~1533           O                149/-15              50                          SOHO, STEREO A              \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-08-31T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-09-06T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are two Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk, and several Active Regions near the STEREO A-facing eastern limb (approximately E80 and E95) that may rotate onto the Earth facing-disk around 2022-09-02. Active Region 13089 (S22W06) is the most magnetically complex region and may continue to be active through the outlook period. Active Region 13088, which was responsible for much of the flaring activity in the current period, has rotated off the Sun's western limb as seen from SDO imagery, but it may continue to produce eruptive activity away the Sun-Earth line.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between below minor and minor levels throughout the outlook period. There is a prominent equatorial coronal hole approaching the Sun's central meridian in SDO AIA 193 and in STEREO A EUVI 195 whose leading edge extends currently close to N10E15. This coronal hole may possibly become geoeffective around 2022-09-05.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220831-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21487/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-08-31T17:26Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (OSIRIS-REx, Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-08-31T17:26:53Z\n## Message ID: 20220831-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
