There was one C-type CME (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=3 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=3 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2017-09-24T21:00Z-24:00Z and 2017-09-25T00:00Z-03:00Z.  This small increase was associated to the arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-09-24.  The solar wind reached values of ~450 km/s on 2017-09-25.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES were elevated and above the threshold of 10^5 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period due to the coronal hole high speed stream that was detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2017-09-14 (see notification 20170921-AL-001 for this reporting period).  The fluxes decreased below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu on 2017-09-22 and remained below the threshold for the remaining time of the reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the significantly elevated energetic electron flux on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above at the beginning of the reporting period.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-09-24T11:36Z     ~675            C               175/41                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-09-27T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-10-03T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the next upcoming period.  There are active regions present on the solar disk that have the potential to produce solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be moderate to high for the upcoming week due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream that was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2017-09-27.  Solar wind speeds are currently >650 km/s and the Kp index reached Kp=5 for the synoptic period of 2017-09-27T06:00Z-09:00Z.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There were two C-type CMEs and one O-type CME (see details below) originating from former AR 12673. Simulations indicated that the two CMEs starting on 2017-09-17T12:09Z and 2017-09-17T14:24Z would impact STEREO A, and have a flank impact at missions at Mars, Spitzer and the Dawn spacecraft (see notifications 20170917-AL-003, 20170917-AL-004 and 20170918-AL-003). The CMEs were observed to arrive at STEREO A at around 2017-09-19T03:00Z.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period. The Kp index reached level 6 (moderate) during the synoptic periods 2017-09-14T15:00Z to 2017-09-14T018:00Z, 2017-09-15T00:00Z to 2017-09-15T03:00Z and 2017-09-16T03:00Z to 2017-09-16T06:00Z, all due to a high speed stream arriving at Earth midday on 2017-09-14 (see notification 20170914-AL-002).\n \nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-09-15T12:55Z and continued to remain elevated through the rest of the reporting period. This was due to the increased solar wind speed starting on 2017-09-14, described above (see notifications 20170915-AL-001, 20170915-AL-002, 20170917-AL-001, 20170917-AL-002, 20170919-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES was at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nTwo solar energetic particle events were detected by STEREO A on 2017-09-13 and 2017-09-17.  The flux of 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 0.1 pfu/MeV starting at 2017-09-13T05:33Z (after a datagap) associated with the CME starting on 2012-09-10T16:09Z and remained elevated until 2017-09-16  (see previous weekly report 20170914-7D-001and notifications 20170913-AL-002, 20170915-AL-003). Soon after, the flux of 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 0.1 pfu/MeV again starting at 2017-09-17T23:40Z (after a datagap) associated with the CMEs starting on 2017-09-17T12:09Z and 2017-09-17T14:24Z and reached a peak flux of 4.75 pfu/MeV on 2017-09-19 when CMEs arrived at the spacecraft (see simulation discussion above and notification 20170918-AL-002).\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft in the vicinity of STEREO A are expected to be medium to high this week, due to the elevated energetic proton flux. Also, missions near Earth may be impacted by the significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-09-16T12:24Z     ~551            C              -165/9                 30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2017-09-17T12:09Z     ~1404           O              -163/-3                49                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2017-09-17T14:24Z     ~899            C              -163/-33               29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-09-20T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-09-26T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week. Former AR 12673 is currently at around -130 degrees longitude and is continuing to produce flares and CMEs and will rotate onto the Earth-facing solar disk within the next three days, and will be near disk center around 2017-09-30. A high speed stream is expected to produce negligible speed increases over the next few days at Earth, but a faster high speed stream is expected around 2017-09-28 that may produce geomagnetic activity.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at very high levels during this reporting period with fifteen M-class flares and four X-class flares (see list below).  There were two C-type, one R-type and two O-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at severe levels with a Kp index of (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=8 for the reporting period.  The highest period of Kp=8 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2017-09-07T21:00Z to 2017-09-08T00:00Z, 2017-09-08T00:00Z to 2017-09-08T03:00Z and 2017-09-08T12:00Z to 2017-09-08T15:00Z.  This severe geomagnetic storm was associated with the CME starting on 2017-09-06T12:24Z (associated with the X9.3-class flare; see notifications 20170906-AL-003, 20170906-AL-004, 20170906-AL-005, 20170906-AL-006, 20170907-AL-002 and 201709907-AL008). The CME arrival at L1 was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at around 2017-09-07T22:30Z (see notification  20170908-AL-003).  Simulations carried out at NASA GSFC CCMC/SWRC indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2017-09-07T23:58Z (see notification 20170908-AL-001 and 20170908-AL-004). \n\nTwo other CME arrivals were detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 during the reporting period.  The CMEs that started on 2017-09-04T19:39Z and  2017-09-04T20:36Z arrived at around 2017-09-06T23:08Z (see notification 20170907-AL-001) and the CME that started on 2017-09-10T16:09Z arrived (glancing blow) around 2017-09-12T19:26Z.  Neither of these CMEs caused a geomagnetic disturbance but they were associated with solar energetic particle events described below. \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-09-09T07:10Z.  These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with extended periods of high solar wind speed after the CME arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2017-09-07T22:30Z (see notifications 20170909-AL-001 and 20170909-AL-002).  \n\nThe > 10 MeV protons flux was already above threshold at the start of the reporting period, due to the solar energetic particle event on 2017-09-04 (see weekly report 20170906-7D-001).  Starting at 2017-09-06T23:45Z the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 100 pfu. Also, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels detected by SOHO exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2017-09-06T23:30Z. This enhancement is associated with the CME and X9.3 flare on 2017-09-06 (see notifications 20170906-AL-003, 20170906-AL-004, 20170906-AL-005, 20170906-AL-006, 20170907-AL-002 and 20170907-AL-008).  \n\nAnother solar energetic particle event was detected by GOES 13 on 2017-09-10.  The flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2017-09-10T16:45Z and the flux of > 100 MeV protons exceeded 1 pfu starting at 2017-09-10T16:25Z (see notifications 20170910-AL-002, 20170910-005).  The flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels detected by SOHO exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2017-09-10T20:00Z (see notification 20170910-AL-008 and 20170912-002).  The energetic proton flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A was at background levels for the entire reporting period, but became slightly elevated (but below threshold) on 2017-09-11.  This solar energetic particle event was associated with the X8.2 flare and its associated CME that started on 2017-09-10T16:09Z. Several neutron monitor stations have detected this solar energetic particle event as a Ground Level Enhancement (GLE).\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been high this week due to the solar energetic particle event and the increased energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2017-09-06  08:57:00  09:17:00  09:10:00   X2.2   S07W33 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-06  11:53:00  12:10:00  12:02:00   X9.3   S07W33 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-06  15:51:00  16:03:00  15:56:00   M2.5   S07W33 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-06  19:20:00  19:35:00  19:30:00   M1.4   S09W38 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-06  23:33:00  23:44:00  23:39:00   M1.2   S08W40 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-07  05:00:00  05:08:00  05:02:00   M2.4   S09W49 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-07  09:50:00  09:58:00  09:54:00   M1.4   S09W49 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-07  10:11:00  10:18:00  10:15:00   M7.3   S08W47 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-07  14:20:00  14:55:00  14:36:00   X1.3   S09W53 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-07  23:51:00  00:14:00  23:59:00   M3.9   S15W50 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-08  02:19:00  02:29:00  02:24:00   M1.3   S09W55 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-08  03:39:00  03:46:00  03:43:00   M1.2   S07W55 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-08  07:40:00  07:58:00  07:49:00   M8.1   S10W58 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-08  15:09:00  16:04:00  15:47:00   M3.0   S09W67 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-08  23:34:00  23:56:00  23:45:00   M2.1   S09W71 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-09  04:14:00  04:43:00  04:28:00   M1.1   S09W72 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-09  10:51:00  11:42:00  11:04:00   M3.7   S09W76 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-09  22:04:00  00:41:00  23:54:00   M1.1   S09W82 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-10  15:35:00  16:31:00  16:06:00   X8.2   S08W88 ( 12673 ) \n \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-09-06T12:24Z     ~1238           O                23/-15               44                          STEREO A                          \n2017-09-06T13:09Z     ~1178           O                99/-4                30                          STEREO A                          \n2017-09-10T16:09Z     ~2650           R                85/-12               54                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-09-07T10:48Z     ~597            C                51/-13               13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2017-09-12T20:42Z     ~741            C               119/-6                25                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-09-13T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-09-19T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the next upcoming week.  Active region 2673 has already rotated behind the west limb but can still produce some far sided activity.  The active region 12680 (currently located on N06E34) is currently producing some solar flares and coronal mass ejections.   Geomagnetic activity is expected to be moderate for the upcoming week due to the expected arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-09-13 and 2017-09-14.  The flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2017-09-13T05:33Z (after a data gap) (see notifications 20170913-AL-001 and 20170913-AL-002).  This is associated with the X8.2-class flare and its associated CME.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

For 40 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO B between about 2017-09-11T15:12Z and 2017-09-12T04:35Z (average arrival 2017-09-11T21:31Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2017-09-13T02:02Z and 2017-09-13T22:08Z (average arrival 2017-09-13T11:18Z) for 30% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2017-09-12T10:41Z and 2017-09-12T23:49Z (average arrival 2017-09-12T16:06Z) for 12% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 75% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-10_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065/20170910_160900_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-10_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065/20170910_160900_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-10_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065/20170910_160900_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-10_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065/20170910_160900_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-10_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065/20170910_160900_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-10_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065/20170910_160900_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065_Mars_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-10_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065/20170910_160900_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-10_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065/20170910_160900_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at SWRC is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-10_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065/Detailed_results_20170910_160900_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX065.txt\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

ENSEMBLE PRODUCT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT MODE. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on the CME with the ID 2017-09-06T12:24:00-CME-001 (see previous notifications 20170907-AL-002 and 20170906-AL-006).\n\nBased on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth. Out of 40 ensemble members (see notes section), 40 (100%) indicate impact at NASA missions near Earth. Ensemble simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2017-09-08T06:58Z and 2017-09-09T02:02Z (average arrival 2017-09-08T15:48Z). The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 87% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-07_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX064/20170906_122400_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX064_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-07_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX064/20170906_122400_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX064_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-07_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX064/20170906_122400_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX064_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-07_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX064/20170906_122400_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX064_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at SWRC is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-07_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX064/Detailed_results_20170906_122400_ncmes1_sims40_HILOX064.txt\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There were 2 C-type CMEs and 1 O-type CME (see details below).   \nBased on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CMEs starting at 2017-09-04T19:39Z and  2017-09-04T20:36Z may impact NASA missions near Earth and OSIRIS-REx  (see notifications 20170905-AL-003, 20170905-AL-004 and 20170905-AL-005). Out of 40 ensemble members (see notes section), 40 (100%) indicate impact at NASA missions near Earth and OSIRIS-REx between about 2017-09-07T00:58Z and 2017-09-07T23:09Z (average arrival 2017-09-07T09:02Z). The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 89% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-7 range (below minor to moderate).  The CME starting at 2017-09-04T20:36Z is associated with the M5.5 flare that peaked at 2017-09-04T20:33Z (see notifications 20170904-AL-001 and 20170904-AL-002).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 was reached during the synoptic periods of 2017-08-31T06:00Z - 2017-08-31T15:00Z, 2017-09-02T03:00Z - 2017-09-02T09:00Z and 2017-09-04T21:00Z - 2017-09-05T00:00Z.  The slight elevation on 2017-08-31 was associated with a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2017-08-31. Simulations carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center indicated that the high speed stream arrival also caused that the magnetopause boundary separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit around 2017-08-31T06:56Z (see notifications 20170831-AL-001 and 20170831-AL-002).  The minor activity on 2017-09-04 was associated to another coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2017-09-04.  The solar wind speed reached values of >650 km/s and >600 km/s, respectively for each high speed stream. \n \nThe 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-09-03T15:25Z. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream arrival described above on 2017-08-31 (see notifications 20170903-AL-001 and 20170903-AL-002).  \n\nThe flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2017-09-05T00:30Z.  This solar energetic particle event detected by GOES was associated with the M5.5 class flare that peaked at 2017-09-04T20:33Z and the CMEs starting at 2017-09-04T19:39Z and 2017-09-04T20:36Z (see notifications 20170905-AL-001 and 20170905-AL-002).  Also, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels at SOHO exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2017-09-04T23:52Z.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been high this week due to the solar energetic particle event and the increased energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location        \n2017-09-04  05:36:00  06:05:00  05:49:00   M1.2   S10W05 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-04  15:11:00  15:33:00  15:30:00   M1.5   S10W08 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-04  18:05:00  18:31:00  18:22:00   M1.0   S10W12 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-04  18:46:00  19:52:00  19:37:00   M1.7   S10W13 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-04  19:59:00  20:06:00  20:02:00   M1.5   S10W14 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-04  20:15:00  20:37:00  20:33:00   M5.5   S10W14 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-04  22:10:00  22:19:00  22:14:00   M2.1   S09W12 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-05  01:04:00  01:11:00  01:08:00   M4.2   S08W20 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-05  03:42:00  04:04:00  03:51:00   M1.0   S09W20 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-05  04:33:00  05:07:00  04:53:00   M3.2   S08W20 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-05  06:34:00  06:43:00  06:40:00   M3.8   S08W20 ( 12673 ) \n2017-09-05  17:37:00  17:51:00  17:43:00   M2.3   S9W20 ( 12673 )  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-09-04T19:39Z     ~710            C                26/-6                25                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2017-09-04T20:36Z     ~1114           O                10/-10               46                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-09-02T16:00Z     ~625            C                90/3                 32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-09-06T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-09-12T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be moderate to high for the upcoming week. Active region 12673 continues to produce solar flares and CMEs. On 2017-09-06 it has produced 3 M-class flares and 2 X-class flares (X2.2 and X9.3) (see notifications 20170906-AL-001, 20170906-AL-002, 20170906-AL-003, and 20170906-AL-004).  The X9.3 flare peaked around  2017-09-06T12:02Z and has an associated CME that started around 2017-09-06T12:24Z and was estimated to be traveling at a speed of ~1800 km/s.  Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that this CME may impact NASA missions near Earth and OSIRIS-REx at about 2017-09-08T18:27Z (plus or minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20170906-AL-005 and 20170906-AL-006).  Also, several additional active regions as present on both the Earth-facing side of the solar disk and in the STEREO A view. Geomagnetic activity is expected to be moderate to high due to the expected arrival of the combined CMEs that started on 2017-09-04T19:39Z, 2017-09-04T20:36Z, and 2017-09-06T12:24Z.  Strong geomagnetic conditions are expected. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

ENSEMBLE PRODUCT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT MODE. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME(s) with ID(s) 2017-09-04T20:36:00-CME-001 and 2017-09-04T19:39:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20170905-AL-004). \n\nBased on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CMEs may impact NASA missions near Earth. Out of 40 ensemble members (see notes section), 40 (100%) indicate impact at NASA missions near Earth. Ensemble simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CMEs will reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2017-09-07T00:58Z and 2017-09-07T23:09Z (average arrival 2017-09-07T09:02Z). The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 89% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-7 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-05_ncmes2_sims40_HILOX063/20170904_203600_ncmes2_sims40_HILOX063_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-05_ncmes2_sims40_HILOX063/20170904_203600_ncmes2_sims40_HILOX063_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-05_ncmes2_sims40_HILOX063/20170904_203600_ncmes2_sims40_HILOX063_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-05_ncmes2_sims40_HILOX063/20170904_203600_ncmes2_sims40_HILOX063_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at SWRC is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-09-05_ncmes2_sims40_HILOX063/Detailed_results_20170904_203600_ncmes2_sims40_HILOX063.txt\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

Updated LASCO data showed an earlier start time, and this CME now has Activity ID 2017-09-04T20:36:00-CME-001.)\n\nEstimated speed: ~1114 km/s.\n\nEstimated opening half-angle: 46 deg.\n\nDirection (lon./lat.): 10/-10 in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial coordinates.\n\nActivity ID: 2017-09-04T20:36:00-CME-001\n\n2: C-type CME detected by STEREO A / SOHO. \n\nStart time of the event: 2017-09-04T19:39Z.\n\nEstimated speed: ~710 km/s.\n\nEstimated opening half-angle: 25 deg.\n\nDirection (lon./lat.): 26/-6 in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial coordinates.\n\nActivity ID: 2017-09-04T19:39:00-CME-001\n\n \nBased on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CMEs may impact NASA missions near Earth. Simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CMEs will reach NASA missions near Earth and OSIRIS-REx at about 2017-09-07T03:45Z (plus or minus 7 hours).
