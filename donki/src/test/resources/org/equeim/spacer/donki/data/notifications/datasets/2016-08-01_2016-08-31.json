There were 2 C-type CMEs (see details below).   Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it was estimated that the CME starting at 2016-08-15T17:36Z may impact Spitzer around 2016-08-17T23:22Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20160815-AL-001).  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu on 2016-08-11T17:45Z and again on 2016-08-13T13:55Z.  These two events of elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE/DSCOVR on 2016-08-09 (see notifications 20160811-AL-001 and 20160813-AL-001).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the events of increased electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt described above.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-08-12T19:09Z     ~505            C               161/-4                16                          STEREO A                          \n2016-08-15T17:36Z     ~750            C              -107/16                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-08-17T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-08-23T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  Active regions on the solar disk appear to have low magnetic complexity.  Currently, the magnetic field at Earth appears to be disturbed due to a sector boundary crossing.  A coronal hole high speed stream is also expected to arrive in a couple of days by 2016-08-19.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There were 2 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2016-08-02T21:00Z to 2016-08-03T03:00Z and 2016-08-03T06:00Z-09:00Z.  This slight elevation of geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2016-08-03.  The solar wind speed reached 725 km/s on 2016-08-05.  Second arrival of coronal high speed stream was detected around 2016-08-09.  The highest solar wind speed observed was around 685 km/s on 2016-08-09.  \n\n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2016-08-06T13:30Z.

There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   Based on preliminary heliospheric analysis and modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it was estimated that the CME starting on 2016-07-28T22:24Z (speed ~350 km/s) may have an impact on NASA missions near Earth between 2016-08-01 and 2016-08-02. The event was associated with a solar complex filament eruption and the transient was predicted to interact and merge with another approaching high speed solar wind stream region (see notification 20160729-AL-001).  The transient was detected by ACE at L1 around 2016-08-02T04:18Z (see notification 20160802-AL-001), and the coronal hole high speed stream arrived on 2016-08-03.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=5 occurred at the end of the reporting period during the synoptic periods of 2016-08-02T21:00Z to 2016-08-03T03:00Z.  This slight elevation could be associated with the arrival of the CME and high speed stream described above. \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-07-30T17:48Z     ~525            C              -168/14                33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-08-03T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-08-09T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.
