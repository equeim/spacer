No CMEs traveling at speeds above 500 km/s were observed during the period.      \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2017-03-21T15:00Z-21:00Z.  This slight enhancement of the geomagnetic activity was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around the beginning of 2017-03-21.  Currently solar wind speeds have reached values of >700 km/s on 2017-03-22.  \n\nOn 2017-03-18 STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream.  Solar wind speed reached values of >600 km/s on 2017-03-18.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-03-22T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-03-28T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the next reporting period. There are some active regions on the far side and the active region 12643 visible on the west side of the solar disk as seen by the SDO AIA instrument that have the capability of producing some solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  The geomagnetic activity has been high starting on 2017-03-21 due to the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream described above.  The energetic electron fluxes are already starting to increase to values 65,000 pfu and they will probably cross the threshold of 10^5 pfu in the next few days.   \n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

No CMEs traveling at speeds above 500 km/s were observed at the available coronagraph imagery.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2017-03-08T21:00Z to 2017-03-09T03:00Z, 2017-03-10T06:00Z-12:00Z, and 2017-03-12T03:00Z-06:00Z.  \n\nOn 2017-03-11 STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream.  Solar wind speed reached values of >500 km/s on 2017-03-14.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES were elevated above the threshold level of 10^5 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period due to the continuing effects of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2017-03-01 (see notifications 20170308-AL-001 and 20170311-AL-001).  After 2017-03-11, the fluxes have remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the rest of the reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated electron fluxes on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-03-15T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-03-21T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the next reporting period. There are some active regions on the far side as seen on the STEREO A EUVI images that have the capability of producing some solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  The geomagnetic activity has slightly increased on 2017-03-15 due to the possible arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream.  Solar wind speeds have remained around 400 km/s.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There were 2 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2017-02-24T00:00Z-03:00Z.  This slight elevation in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2017-02-23.  Solar wind speeds reached values of >650 km/s on 2017-02-24.  \n\nThe IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments at STEREO A detected the arrival of a couple small coronal hole high speed streams around 2017-02-26 and 2017-02-27.  The solar wind speed reached values >550 km/s on 2017-02-28. \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-02-23T11:09Z     ~675            C               -44/29                20                          STEREO A                          \n2017-02-23T22:39Z     ~530            C               -43/31                18                          STEREO A                          \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-03-01T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-03-07T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the next reporting period. The geomagnetic activity is expected to be enhanced for the upcoming reporting due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-03-01.  Solar wind speeds are currently detected by DSCOVR at L1 to be around >650km/s on 2017-03-01.  \n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
