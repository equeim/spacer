There were 4 C-type CMEs (see details below).   Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it was estimated that the CME starting at 2016-07-23T05:24Z may impact Dawn (glancing blow) around 2016-08-01T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20160723-AL-005).  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2016-07-19T21:00Z to 2016-07-20T06:00Z and 2016-07-24T18:00Z-21:00Z.  This slight increase in geomagnetic activity at the beginning of the reporting period was associated with an interplanetary shock detected by ACE at L1 around 2016-07-19T23:00Z.  This signature could be the arrival of the two complex CMEs that started on 2016-07-17 (see notification 20160720-AL-003).  Simulations carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma crossed geosynchronous orbit starting at 2016-07-20T00:46Z due to this interplanetary shock (see notifications 20160720-AL-001 and 20160720-AL-002).  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.  \n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2016-07-21  00:41:00  00:50:00  00:46:00   M1.2   N5W38 ( 12567 )  \n2016-07-21  01:34:00  02:04:00  01:48:00   M1.0   N5W40 ( 12567 )  \n2016-07-23  01:46:00  02:23:00  02:11:00   M5.0   N05W73 ( 12567 ) \n2016-07-23  05:00:00  05:24:00  05:16:00   M7.6   N05W73 ( 12567 ) \n2016-07-23  05:27:00  05:33:00  05:31:00   M5.5   N05W75 ( 12567 ) \n2016-07-24  06:09:00  06:32:00  06:20:00   M2.0   N06W89 ( 12567 ) \n2016-07-24  17:30:00  18:12:00  17:43:00   M1.9   N07W89 ( 12567 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-07-21T01:25Z     ~558            C              -140/23                27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2016-07-22T02:48Z     ~714            C                95/2                 35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2016-07-23T05:24Z     ~740            C                70/15                40                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2016-07-25T01:25Z     ~500            C                91/-2                16                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-07-27T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-08-02T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  Former active regions 12565 and 12567 are now behind the west limb and can produce flares and coronal mass ejections on the far side.  Geomagnetic activity is currently elevated due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 on 2016-07-28.  Solar wind speeds are expected to remain elevated for the next few days.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There were 3 C-type CMEs (see details below).   Based on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it was estimated that the CMEs starting at 2016-07-17T11:24Z and Z2016-07-17T12:48Z may impact Mars between about 2016-07-22T03:38Z and 2016-07-22T12:16Z (average arrival 2016-07-22T07:05Z) for 18% of simulations, and also NASA missions near Earth between about 2016-07-20T13:46Z and 2016-07-21T10:39Z (average arrival 2016-07-20T23:32Z) for 91% of simulations (see notifications 20160718-AL-001 and 20160718-AL-002).  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2016-07-19T21:00Z to 2016-07-20T06:00Z.  This slight increase in geomagnetic activity is associated with an interplanetary shock detected by ACE at L1 around 2016-07-19T23:00Z.  This signature could be the arrival of the two complex CMEs described above that started on 2016-07-17 (see notification 20160720-AL-003).  Simulations carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma crossed geosynchronous orbit starting at 2016-07-20T00:46Z due to this interplanetary shock (see notifications 20160720-AL-001 and 20160720-AL-002).  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES were elevated during the reporting period, but remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-07-17T12:48Z     ~584            C               -22/-2                29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-07-13T19:09Z     ~550            C               -50/-1                13                          STEREO A                          \n2016-07-15T13:36Z     ~539            C                76/-26               25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-07-20T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-07-26T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  There are a few active regions located on the solar disk that can produce solar flares or coronal mass ejections.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to remain elevated during the first few days of the next reporting period due to the ongoing transient activity described above.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 95% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 2-4 range (below minor to below minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-07-18_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060/20160717_112400_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-07-18_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060/20160717_112400_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-07-18_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060/20160717_112400_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060_Earth_stack.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-07-18_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060/20160717_112400_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-07-18_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060/20160717_112400_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-07-18_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060/20160717_112400_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060_Mars_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at SWRC is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-07-18_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060/Detailed_results_20160717_112400_ncmes2_sims37_HILOX060.txt\n\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
