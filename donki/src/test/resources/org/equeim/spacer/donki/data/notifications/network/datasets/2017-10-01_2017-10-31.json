There were 1 C-type CME and 2 O-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2017-10-24T15:00Z-18:00Z.  This slight enhancement in the geomagnetic activity was associated with a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2017-10-24.  \n\nSTEREO Ahead IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of the CMEs (that started on 2017-10-18T05:48Z and 2017-10-18T07:48Z) around 2017-10-21T02:30Z (see notification 20171018-AL-002).  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES were elevated above the threshold of of 10^5 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period due to a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2017-10-11, but declined to background levels on 2017-10-19 and remained nominal for the rest of the reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2017-10-20  23:10:00  23:37:00  23:28:00   M1.1   S10E90 ( 12685 )\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-10-18T05:48Z     ~1439           O              -122/-38               33                          SOHO                              \n2017-10-18T07:48Z     ~1468           O              -117/-9                42                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2017-10-18T15:06Z     ~586            C              -119/9                 12                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-10-25T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-10-31T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.

There were 4 C-type CMEs (see details below).  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period. Geomagnetic Kp index reached level 6 (moderate) during the synoptic periods of 2017-10-13T12:00Z to 2017-10-13T15:00Z and 2017-10-13T18:00Z to 2017-10-13T21:00Z. This enhancement in the geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 on 2017-10-11 (see notifications 20171013-AL-001 and 20171013-AL-002). Solar wind speed reached values of ~700 km/s on 2017-10-14.\n\nSTEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-10-11 and also on 2017-10-15 with the solar wind speed reaching values of ~500 km/s and ~600 km/s, respectively.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-10-14T12:00Z and remained elevated crossing the threshold several times up to 2017-10-18. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above (see notifications 20171014-AL-001, 20171014-AL-002, 20171016-AL-001 and 20171018-AL-001).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-10-11T15:09Z     ~557            C               139/22                29                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2017-10-13T09:09Z     ~600            C               168/13                19                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2017-10-14T08:24Z     ~652            C               154/14                25                          STEREO A                          \n2017-10-17T03:36Z     ~510            C              -110/-11               24                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-10-18T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-10-24T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week. STEREO A EUVI images show three active regions, one of them close to disk center around 2017-10-18 which is the source of two fast CMEs on 2017-10-18 heading towards STEREO A that enhanced the flux of 13-100 MeV protons but did not crossed the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV. This active region will rotate on to the Earth facing side of the solar disk in the upcoming week and still has potential for solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Geomagnetic activity may increase around 2017-10-21 due to a high speed stream originating from a small coronal hole close to disk center seen in SDO around 2017-10-18.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

This slight enhancement in the geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 on 2017-10-04.  Another coronal hole high speed stream arrival was detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2017-10-10.  \n\nSTEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-10-03 that lasted several days with the solar wind speed reaching values of ~600 km/s.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-10-11T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-10-17T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.

This geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 on 2017-09-27 (see notifications 20170927-AL-001, 20170927-AL-002, 20170928-AL-001 and 20170928-AL-002).  \n \nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-09-29T08:45Z and remained elevated crossing the threshold several times up to 2017-10-02. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above (see notifications 20170929-AL-001, 20170929-AL-002 and 20171001-AL-001).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-10-04T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-10-10T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.

GOES 13 \"greater than 0.8 MeV\" integral electron flux first exceeded 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-09-29T08:45Z (see recent notification 20170929-AL-002). For the past two days, the electron flux has been above the threshold or elevated.\n\nThe elevated energetic electron flux levels are caused by the high speed stream starting at 2017-09-27T04:06Z.\n\nNASA spacecraft at GEO, MEO and other orbits passing through or in the vicinity of the Earth's outer radiation belt can be impacted.\n\nActivity ID: 2017-09-29T08:45:00-RBE-001. \n\n## Notes: \n\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
