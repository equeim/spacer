For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-02-27T13:35Z and 2023-02-28T00:24Z (average arrival 2023-02-27T18:25Z) for 16% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-02-27T10:30Z and 2023-02-28T00:55Z (average arrival 2023-02-27T18:10Z) for 79% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 57% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-26_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020/20230225_224600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-26_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020/20230225_224600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-26_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020/20230225_224600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-26_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020/20230225_224600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-26_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020/20230225_224600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-26_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020/20230225_224600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event is also predicted to have a glancing blow at OSIRIS-REx at 2023-03-01T01:25Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20230226-AL-003).\n\nThis CME event (2023-02-25T19:38:00-CME-001) is associated with M6.3 flare with ID 2023-02-25T18:40:00-FLR-001 which peaked at 2023-02-25T19:44Z (see notifications 20230225-AL-001, 20230225-AL-002).\n\nThe CME event is also associated with an SEP event at STEREO A with ID 2023-02-25T20:41:00-SEP-001 (see notifications 20230225-AL-004, 20230225-AL-005), an SEP event at GOES-P with ID 2023-02-25T21:10:00-SEP-001 (see notifications 20230225-AL-006, 20230225-AL-007), an SEP event at SOHO with IDs 2023-02-25T21:56:00-SEP-001 and 2023-02-25T21:57:00-SEP-001 (see notifications 20230225-AL-010).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-26_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020/Detailed_results_20230225_224600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020.txt\n###\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"MPC","messageID":"20230226-AL-006","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/23983/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-02-26T21:01Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Magnetopause Crossing\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-02-26T21:01:36Z\n## Message ID: 20230226-AL-006\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 40 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-02-26T07:05Z and 2023-02-26T21:05Z (average arrival 2023-02-26T15:56Z) for 72% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-02-26T06:28Z and 2023-02-26T22:27Z (average arrival 2023-02-26T14:03Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 80% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 6-8 range (moderate to severe).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-25_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019/20230224_203600_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-25_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019/20230224_203600_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-25_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019/20230224_203600_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-25_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019/20230224_203600_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-25_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019/20230224_203600_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-25_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019/20230224_203600_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2023-02-24T20:36:00-CME-001) is also predicted to have impacts to OSIRIS-REx at 2023-02-28T16:00Z (glancing blow) and Solar Orbiter at 2023-02-27T03:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20230224-AL-002).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-25_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019/Detailed_results_20230224_203600_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019.txt\n###\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"SEP","messageID":"20230225-AL-007","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/23944/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-02-25T21:34Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - SEP\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-02-25T21:34:15Z\n## Message ID: 20230225-AL-007\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

A slight elevation in the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A was seen starting after a data gap on 2023-02-18 and remained slightly elevated for the remainder of the reporting period. This enhancement may have been associated with the X2.2 flare from Active Region 13229 (N25E65) that peaked at 2023-02-17T20:16Z. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-02-15  04:33:00  05:07:00  04:47:00   M1.1   N28W90 ( 13213 ) \n2023-02-15  05:16:00  05:30:00  05:23:00   M2.0   N27W90 ( 13213 ) \n2023-02-15  06:42:00  07:19:00  07:05:00   M1.3   N30W90 ( 13213 ) \n2023-02-15  21:05:00  21:18:00  21:14:00   M1.0   N30W90 ( 13213 ) \n2023-02-16  00:19:00  00:43:00  00:32:00   M1.1   N24E90 ( 13229 ) \n2023-02-17  19:38:00  20:50:00  20:16:00   X2.2   N25E65 ( 13229 ) \n2023-02-20  14:47:00  15:03:00  14:58:00   M4.4   N24E90 ( 13234 ) \n2023-02-21  11:05:00  11:14:00  11:11:00   M1.5   N25E68 ( 13234 ) \n2023-02-21  11:14:00  11:31:00  11:23:00   M4.7   N25E68 ( 13234 ) \n2023-02-21  19:57:00  20:30:00  20:17:00   M5.0   N24E65 ( 13234 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-02-15T02:12Z     ~624            C               -15/-11               41                          SOHO                              \n2023-02-17T20:23Z     ~1487           O               -20/4                 45                          STEREO A                          \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-02-16T10:48Z     ~1577           O                56/26                36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-16T21:36Z     ~696            C               -90/25                32                          SOHO                              \n2023-02-17T13:25Z     ~540            C              -134/37                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-18T02:48Z     ~992            C              -161/1                 45                          SOHO                              \n2023-02-18T10:12Z     ~563            C              -168/-54               33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-18T13:48Z     ~756            C              -139/-47               15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-19T09:12Z     ~535            C                49/-16               28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-19T17:00Z     ~584            C                73/-33               48                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-21T09:09Z     ~800            C               144/-18               44                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-02-21T20:48Z     ~516            C               -66/20                31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-02-22T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-02-28T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently seven active regions on the Earth-facing disk, the most notable of which are Active Regions 13229 (N25W03) and 13234 (N24E50).  Both regions produced numerous M-class flares during the reporting period. Additionally, Active Region 13229 produced the X2.2-class flare which was associated with the O-type CME (see list above) that arrived at missions near Earth and at STEREO A on 2023-02-20 (mentioned above). Increased flaring activity may continue throughout the outlook period as Active Regions 13234 (N24E50), 13230 (S23E20), and 13229 (N25W03) rotate across the Earth-facing disk. Additional active regions seen along STEREO A EUVI 195's southern limb may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2023-02-23.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low to minor throughout the outlook period. A S-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-02-21T02:48Z may impact Earth as a glancing blow around 2023-02-24T22:00Z. The expected Kp range is 2-3 (low). Two coronal holes are currently visible on the Earth-facing disk. The coronal hole centered around S35W20 may reach geoeffective longitudes by 2023-02-24 due to its western extension. The second coronal hole centered around S05E30 is expected to reach the central meridian by 2023-02-25.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230221-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/23864/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-02-21T21:16Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Parker Solar Probe)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-02-21T21:16:56Z\n## Message ID: 20230221-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were 2 O-type CMEs and 8 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-02-11T11:12Z would impact Missions near Earth at 2023-02-13T11:06Z with a maximum Kp index 5-7 (minor to strong), Mars at 2023-02-14T22:16Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-02-12T19:59Z, STEREO A at 2023-02-13T05:53Z and Lucy at 2023-02-14T16:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230211-AL-003). Additionally, an ensemble for this CME was made with 24 members. The CME was estimated to reach NASA Missions near Earth between about 2023-02-13T09:14Z and 2023-02-13T21:02Z (average arrival 2023-02-13T16:10Z) for 58% of simulations (see notification 20230214-AL-001 and full details at https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-13_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX169/Detailed_results_20230211_111500_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX169.txt). \n\nThe possible arrival of this CME may have been detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE on 2023-02-14T21:57Z with a maximum observed Kp index of Kp=5.33 (see notification 20230215-AL-001). Analysis of this arrival signature is ongoing.\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CME was predicted to impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-02-11T11:36Z  Parker Solar Probe at 2023-02-13T09:00Z (Glancing Blow) (see notification 20230211-AL-004)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4.67 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4.67 occurred during the synoptic period of 2023-02-09T21:00Z to 2023-02-10T00:00Z. This enhancement of geomagnetic activity may be associated with small and diffuse coronal holes high speed streams arriving at L1 around 2023-02-10. The maximum sustained solar wind speed observed by DSCOVR at L1 reached approximately 600 km/s.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu starting at 2023-02-08T12:45Z. The elevated energetic electron flux levels were likely caused by a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-02-05. The solar wind reached a maximum sustained speed of approximately 600 km/s (see notifications 20230208-AL-002 and 20230208-AL-003). The energetic electron flux remained elevated and crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu again at 2023-02-12T14:00Z, likely in association with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream on 2023-02-10 combined with the waning influence from the aforementioned earlier coronal hole high speed stream that started on 2023-02-05 (see notifications 20230212-AL-001 and 20230212-AL-002).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class

2023-02-21T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate to high levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently 13 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13213 (located at N28W92) has produced 11 M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity during the beginning of the outlook period. Additionally, Active Region 13217 (located at S10W06) produced a X1.1 flare as well as several lower level M-class flares of the reporting period. This Active Region may also continue to produce flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Finally, there is an unnumbered Active Region visible on the NW limb in STEREO A EUVI imagery near latitude N25 that is expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2023-02-16.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period due to the currently developing arrival signature associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE around 2023-02-14T21:57Z, possibly associated with the O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-02-11T11:12Z mentioned above (see notification 20230215-AL-001). There may also be minor enhancements in geomagnetic activity due to the anticipated arrival of a C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-02-15T02:12Z, which is predicted to impact missions near Earth around 2023-02-17 (see notification 20230215-AL-002). There may be additional increases in geomagnetic activity during the outlook period due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream from a coronal hole currently centered around S10E30 which may reach geoeffective longitudes on or around 2023-02-21.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230215-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/23774/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-02-15T16:37Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Mars, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, Lucy, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-02-15T16:37:20Z\n## Message ID: 20230215-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 2-4 (below minor) (see notification 20230207-AL-001).\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact other locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-02-01T07:54Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-02-05T00:00Z (glancing blow) and Parker Solar Probe at 2023-02-03T07:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230201-AL-001)\n2023-02-02T09:36Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-02-06T19:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230202-AL-001)\n2023-02-03T00:48Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-02-04T09:52Z (see notifications 20230203-AL-001 and 20230203-AL-002)\n2023-02-06T12:36Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-02-10T00:00Z\n2023-02-07T15:23Z   Lucy at 2023-02-12T12:00Z (glancing blow), Solar Orbiter at 2023-02-10T12:00Z (glancing blow), and STEREO A at 2023-02-10T15:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230207-AL-001)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2023-02-07T00:00Z-06:00Z. This enhancement of geomagnetic activity may be associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-02-05. The maximum sustained solar wind speed observed by DSCOVR at L1 reached approximately 600 km/s. STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments detected an interplanetary shock around 2023-02-05T15:30Z that may have also been associated with the previously mentioned coronal hole high speed stream.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES had a slight increase towards the end of the reporting period, but remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-02-07  13:33:00  14:15:00  13:53:00   M1.0   S14E90           \n2023-02-07  20:01:00  20:14:00  20:07:00   M1.5   N29E02 ( 13213 ) \n2023-02-07  22:46:00  23:05:00  22:58:00   M3.8   N28E02 ( 13213 ) \n2023-02-07  23:05:00  23:09:00  23:07:00   M6.3   N30E03 ( 13213 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-02-07T15:23Z     ~525            C               -11/28                25                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-02-01T07:54Z     ~1077           O               133/26                49                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-01T14:23Z     ~1000           O               105/56                16                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-02-02T09:36Z     ~851            C                53/22                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-02T12:12Z     ~1193           O              -125/37                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-02T18:48Z     ~656            C               104/42                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-03T00:12Z     ~530            C              NONE/-36(POS)          18                          SOHO\n2023-02-03T00:48Z     ~1261           O              -131/21                50                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-03T15:12Z     ~859            C              -112/38                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-04T06:24Z     ~583            C                22/-48               11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-04T07:36Z     ~931            C              -102/41                17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-04T13:48Z     ~689            C              -129/45                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-05T05:48Z     ~949            C               -99/53                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-05T13:09Z     ~844            C               -65/58                18                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-02-05T15:16Z     ~870            C              -126/-16               16                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-05T19:36Z     ~539            C               -66/54                10                          SOHO                              \n2023-02-06T12:36Z     ~673            C                48/-36               26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-07T03:12Z     ~1075           O               -75/65                26                          SOHO                              \n2023-02-07T22:00Z     ~560            C               70/-47                24                          SOHO, STEREO A\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-02-08T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-02-14T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate to high levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently 9 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13213 (N31W01) produced 3 M-class flares during the reporting period. This Active Region may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity during the outlook period. Newly numbered Active Region 13217, located around latitude S10, has begun to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk as seen in EUV imagery from STEREO A and SDO, and was the potential source of the M1.0 class flare that peaked at 2023-02-07T13:53Z.  This Active Region may continue to produce increased flaring activity as it continues to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. There may be minor enhancements in the geomagnetic activity due to the anticipated arrival of a C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-02-07T15:23Z which is predicted to impact missions near Earth around 2023-02-10. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-02-08T12:45Z and may remain elevated throughout the outlook period (see notifications 20230208-AL-002 and 20230208-AL-003).

The energetic electron flux levels subsided towards the end of 2023-01-30 and remained at background levels until the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-01-25  09:37:00  10:28:00  10:11:00   M4.6   S14E87 ( 13190 ) \n2023-01-25  16:42:00  17:13:00  17:01:00   M1.3   N16W88 ( 13192 ) \n2023-01-25  22:23:00  22:44:00  22:35:00   M2.0   N14W88 ( 13192 ) \n2023-01-26  12:53:00  13:15:00  13:06:00   M2.8   N30W91 ( 13192 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-01-25T09:38Z     ~846            C               -50/38                28                          STEREO A                          \n2023-01-25T10:23Z     ~508            C                88/-23               34                          STEREO A                          \n2023-01-25T21:12Z     ~575            C               -90/20                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-26T01:36Z     ~1016           O              -134/-14               46                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-26T20:12Z     ~932            C               -98/-25               17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-26T21:24Z     ~945            C               146/33                11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-26T23:36Z     ~563            C               124/-47               31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-27T06:36Z     ~655            C                47/29                11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-27T22:36Z     ~570            C               159/-41               29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-29T06:38Z     ~820            C               133/-58               35                          STEREO A, SOHO   \n2023-01-29T07:23Z     ~556            C            NONE(POS)/-66            26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-29T07:23Z     ~547            C               114/-41               30                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-01-29T19:38Z     ~677            C                22/32                24                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-01-30T07:38Z     ~814            C              -143/-34               41                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-01-30T18:09Z     ~705            C               149/-37               40                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-01-31T10:09Z     ~643            C                90/80                12                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-02-01T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-02-07T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels throughout the outlook period. All four M-class flares of the reporting period were produced by Active Regions 13190 and 13192 which have long since rotated off the Earth facing solar disk. There are currently 5 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk, two of which, Active Regions 13204 (N24W82) and 13205 (S23W88), have remained relatively quiet and are expected to rotate off of the Earth-facing disk by 2023-02-02. Active Regions 13207 (S11E55) and 13206 (S22E23) have produced most of the latest lower C-class flares and may continue to display increased activity throughout the reporting period. Finally, an unnumbered Active Region currently on the southeast limb as seen in STEREO A EUV imagery at the latitude of S20, may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2023-02-03.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be low to minor during the outlook period. Currently, there is a developing signature detected by ACE and DSCOVR at L1 associated with an interplanetary shock on 2023-02-01T15:40Z (see notification 20230201-AL-002), which may be associated with a coronal hole high speed stream (event is still under analysis).  This signature is preceded by a brief coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-01-30. Additional increase in geomagnetic activity may occur towards the end of the outlook period due to a possible high speed stream from the coronal hole currently located at N10E20, which could cross the central meridian on 2023-01-03 and become geoeffective around 2023-01-07.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20230201-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/23547/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-02-01T19:09Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-02-01T19:09:13Z\n## Message ID: 20230201-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
