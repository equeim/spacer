This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low levels during this reporting period. There were no significant flares or CMEs.      \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2018-09-21T21:00Z - 2018-09-22T03:00Z. This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-09-21. Solar wind speed reached values of ~550 km/s on 2018-09-22.\n\nSTEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments also detected the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2018-09-20. Solar wind speed reached values of ~450 km/s on 2018-09-22.  \n\nThe >0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was significantly elevated, around 70-80% of the threshold level of 10^5 pfu most of the entire reporting period. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with two coronal hole high speed streams that were detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-09-17 and the one detected around 2018-09-21, respectively (see notifications 20180919-AL-001, 20180921-AL-001 and 20180923-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to energetic electron fluxes on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2018-09-26T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2018-10-02T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week. There are only a couple of decayed active regions present on the visible solar surface that could produce some flare and CME activity. Geomagnetic activity is also expected to be low for the upcoming week.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There were no significant flares or CMEs.    \n  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=6 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2018-09-11T06:00Z-12:00Z (see notifications 20180911-AL-001 and 20180911-AL-002). This moderate increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-09-10. Solar wind speed reached values of ~570 km/s starting on 2018-09-11. \nAnother coronal hole high speed stream was detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-09-07, solar wind speed reached values around 500 km/s on 2018-09-07.  \n\nSTEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2018-09-08. Solar wind speed reached values of ~600 km/s on 2018-09-08.\n\n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed   \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2018-09-12T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2018-09-18T23:59Z\n\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week. There are a few small or decayed active regions present on the solar disk that have some potential for flare or CME activity. Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week due to the expected arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2018-09-17. The greater than 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux at the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 could cross the threshold of 10^5 pfu around 2018-09-12 due to the coronal hole high speed stream described above.  \n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
