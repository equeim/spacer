Date:  2024-06-04T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate to high levels in the outlook period. There are currently seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13697 (currently located at S18E57) has produced two X-class flares and several M-class flares at the time of this writing, and will likely continue to exhibit notable flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Active Regions 13691 and 13695 (currently located at N27E08 and N28E21, respectively) have been responsible for a few M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity throughout the outlook period. It is highly suspected that Active Regions 13691 (N27E08) and 13697 (S18E57) are respectively previously numbered Active Regions 13663 and 13664, which were responsible for numerous X-class and M-class flares observed during prior reporting periods. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. A slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity may be observed on or around 2024-06-01 due to a possible cursory glancing blow from a C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO imagery at 2024-05-29T14:48Z. The possibility of enhancements in geomagnetic activity may increase as Active Regions 13691 (N27E08) and 13697 (S18E57) continue to rotate further onto and across the Earth-facing disk over the course of the outlook period. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"Report","messageID":"20240529-7D-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/31214/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-05-29T22:49Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (CCMC DONKI)\n## Message Type: Weekly Space Weather Summary Report for May 22, 2024 - May 28, 2024\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-05-29T22:49:45Z\n## Report Coverage Begin Date: 2024-05-22T00:00Z\n## Report Coverage End Date: 2024-05-28T23:59Z\n## Message ID: 20240529-7D-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Date:  2024-06-04T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate to high levels in the outlook period. There are currently seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13697 (currently located at S18E57) has produced two X-class flares and several M-class flares at the time of this writing, and will likely continue to exhibit notable flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Active Regions 13691 and 13695 (currently located at N27E08 and N28E21, respectively) have been responsible for a few M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity throughout the outlook period. It is highly suspected that Active Regions 13691 (N27E08) and 13697 (S18E57) are respectively previously numbered Active Regions 13663 and 13664, which were responsible for numerous X-class and M-class flares observed during prior reporting periods. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. A slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity may be observed on or around 2024-06-01 due to a possible cursory glancing blow from a C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO imagery at 2024-05-29T14:48Z. The possibility of enhancements in geomagnetic activity may increase as Active Regions 13691 (N27E08) and 13697 (S18E57) continue to rotate further onto and across the Earth-facing disk over the course of the outlook period. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240529-AL-005","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/31212/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-05-29T21:43Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Psyche, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-05-29T21:43:36Z\n## Message ID: 20240529-AL-005\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

notification 20240520-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 6 during the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 6 occurred during the synoptic periods 2024-05-16T06:00Z-09:00Z and 2024-05-17T18:00Z-21:00Z (see notifications 20240516-AL-002, 20240516-AL-004, and 20240517-AL-006). The first enhancement of geomagnetic activity was likely associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-05-16T04:35Z which may have been associated with a possible transient arrival (see notification 20240516-AL-003). This arrival may have been detected by STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments around 2024-05-16T11:37Z. The second enhancement of geomagnetic activity was likely associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-05-17T12:40Z which was associated with the arrival of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-05-14T10:09Z (see notification 20240517-AL-002). \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt briefly crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2024-05-15T13:55Z (see notifications 20240515-AL-005 and 20240515-AL-007) and subsided to near background levels by 2024-05-16. This brief elevation of energetic electron flux levels was associated with the combined arrival of the C-type CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO imagery at 2024-05-08T05:36Z, 2024-05-08T12:24Z, and 2024-05-08T19:12Z detected by ACE at L1 at 2024-05-10T16:36Z during the previous reporting period. This enhancement was also associated with the combined arrival of the O-type CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO imagery 2024-05-08T22:24Z and 2024-05-09T09:24Z detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-05-11T09:30Z during the previous reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton fluxes at GOES, SOHO and STEREO A remained above threshold levels at the beginning of the reporting period due to a solar energetic particle event first detected in the previous reporting period at 2024-05-13T12:44Z (see notifications 20240513-AL-006, 20240513-AL-007, 20240513-AL-008,  20240513-AL-009, and 20240513-AL-011). This enhanced particle environment at SOHO, GOES and STEREO A began to subside on 2024-05-16, decreasing below each spacecrafts respective threshold and remaining slightly elevated above background levels. The energetic particle fluxes at all three locations decreased to background levels on 2024-05-18.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this reporting period due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt, the solar energetic particle events detected at SOHO, GOES, and STEREO A, and the geomagnetic activity described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-05-15  08:18:00  08:52:00  08:37:00   X3.4

Active Region 13685 (currently located at S12W09) produced an X-class flare and the majority of M-class flares observed during reporting period, and will likely continue to exhibit notable flaring activity throughout the outlook period. It is also possible that previously numbered Active Regions 13663 and 13664, which were responsible for numerous X and M-class flares observed during prior reporting periods, may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk again on or around 2024-05-24 and 2024-05-27, respectively.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity may be observed on or around 2024-05-22 and 2024-05-23 due to possible glancing blow arrivals from the C-type CMEs first visible in SOHO LASCO imagery at 2024-05-19T14:23Z, 2024-05-19T19:09Z, 2024-05-20T20:12Z, and 2024-05-20T21:12Z described above. Additionally, coronal holes currently centered around N40W20 and S35E20 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-05-23 and 2024-05-27, respectively.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240521-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/31064/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-05-21T18:36Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-05-21T18:36:36Z\n## Message ID: 20240521-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

reaching 9. The geomagnetic storm lasted from 2024-05-10T15:00Z to 2024-05-12T06:00Z, with Kp values ranging from 6.67 to 9 (see notifications 20240510-AL-013, 20240510-AL-014, 20240510-AL-015, 20240510-AL-016, 20240511-AL-002, 20240511-AL-003, and 20240511-AL-015). The highest value of Kp=9 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2024-05-10T21:00Z to 2024-05-11T03:00Z and 2024-05-11T09:00Z-2024-05-11T12:00Z (see notifications 20240511-AL-002, 20240511-AL-003, 20240511-AL-015). This extreme geomagnetic storm was associated with an interplanetary shock detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR around 2024-05-10T16:36Z (see notification 20240510-AL-010) that was likely caused by the combined arrival of the C-type CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-05-08T05:36Z, 2024-05-08T12:24Z, and 2024-05-08T19:12Z. This storm may have been further enhanced by an interplanetary shock detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR around 2024-05-11T09:30Z and possibly associated with the combined arrival of the O-type CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-05-08T22:24Z and 2024-05-09T09:24Z (see notification 20240510-AL-017). The combined arrival of these CMEs was also detected by STEREO A at 2024-05-10T14:00Z. These arrivals are still under analysis.\n\nA period of moderate geomagnetic activity with Kp index <= 6 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2024-05-12T21:00Z to 2024-05-13T06:00Z (see notifications 20240513-AL-001, 20240513-AL-002). This geomagnetic storm was associated with an interplanetary shock detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR around 2024-05-12T08:57Z that was likely caused by the arrival of the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-05-10T07:12Z (see notification 20240510-AL-003). \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux was elevated but below the threshold on 2024-05-13 in association with the above mentioned arrivals of multiple CMEs on 2024-05-10T16:36Z, 2024-05-11T09:30Z and 2024-05-12T08:57Z.\n\nSeveral solar energetic particle events were detected by SOHO, GOES, and STEREO A during the reporting period. At SOHO, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-05-10T12:59Z and at GOES the flux of >10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2024-05-10T13:35Z (see notifications 20240510-AL-004, 20240510-AL-005). At STEREO A, the flux of the 13-100 MeV protons exceeded the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-05-10T14:50Z (see notifications 20240510-AL-008, 20240510-AL-009). This solar energetic particle event was likely associated with an X3.9 flare from Active Region 13664 peaking at  2024-05-10T06:54Z  (see notifications 20240510-AL-001, 20240510-AL-002) and an associated O-type CME first detected in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-05-10T07:12Z (see notification 20240510-AL-003), with contributions from numerous other X and M-class flares from the Active Region 13664 starting as early as 2024-05-08. By the start of 2024-05-11 the proton fluxes at GOES and at STEREO A briefly dipped below their respective thresholds while at SOHO such dip was likely obscured by a data gap.\n\nJust hours later, at 2024-05-11T02:10Z, the flux of >100 MeV protons at GOES exceeded the threshold of 1 pfu while the already elevated >10 MeV proton flux again rose above 10 pfu at 2024-05-11T02:10Z (see notifications 20240511-AL-006, 20240511-AL-007). At STEREO A the proton flux rose above its threshold again at 2024-05-11T04:07Z (see notifications 20240511-AL-008, 20240511-AL-013). This second SEP event was associated with an X5.8 flare from Active Region 3664 peaking at  2024-05-11T01:23Z (see notifications 20240511-AL-004, 20240511-AL-005) and an associated O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-05-11T01:36Z (see notifications 20240511-AL-009, 20240511-AL-012). The enhanced particle environment at all three locations decreased below thresholds on 2024-05-12. \n\nDuring the third SEP event of the reporting period the >10 MeV proton flux at GOES and the proton fluxes at SOHO and STEREO again exceeded their respective thresholds: the flux at STEREO at 2024-05-13T12:44Z (see notifications 20240513-AL-006, 20240513-AL-007), the >10 MeV proton flux at GOES at 2024-05-13T14:00Z (see notifications 20240513-AL-008,  20240513-AL-009) and the flux at SOHO during the data gap ending at 2024-05-13T18:07Z (see notification 20240513-AL-011). This third SEP event was associated with multiple M-class flares from Active Region 13664 including an M1.2 flare peaking at 2024-05-13T08:20Z, an M1.4 flare with peaking at 2024-05-13T08:29Z, an M4.9 flare peaking at 2024-05-13T09:33Z, and an M6.6 flare peaking at 2024-05-13T09:44Z (see notifications 20240513-AL-003 and 20240513-AL-004). \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been high this reporting period due to the solar energetic particle events detected at SOHO, GOES, and STEREO A and geomagnetic activity described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-05-08  01:33:00  01:48:00  01:41:00   X1.0   N25W60 ( 13663 ) \n2024-05-08

There are currently 11 Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13664 was responsible for the vast majority of the X-class and M-class flares during the reporting period before rotating off of the Earth-facing disk on 2024-05-14, and has continued to exhibit high levels of flaring and CME activity while behind the limb. An unnumbered Active Region on the east limb currently around latitude S10 as seen in available EUV imagery produced one X-class flare and two M-class flares during the outlook period and may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity as it rotates onto the Earth-facing disk.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity might be observed on or around 2024-05-17 due to a possible glancing blow from the C-type CME first visible in STEREO COR2 imagery at 2024-05-14T10:09Z.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240516-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/30926/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-05-16T02:22Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (Mars, OSIRIS-APEX, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-05-16T02:22:38Z\n## Message ID: 20240516-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Some CME parameters from these dates were not simulated due to simulation constraints.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at strong levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6.67 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=6.67 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2024-05-02T15:00Z-21:00Z (see notifications 20240502-AL-004, 20240502-AL-005, 20240502-AL-006). This strong enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR around 2024-05-02T07:46Z (see notification 20240502-AL-001) which may be associated with a coronal hole high speed stream and potentially embedded glancing blow from a CME. The arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream was also detected by STEREO A on 2024-05-02.\n\nAdditionally, geomagnetic activity reached Kp=5 during the synoptic period of 2024-05-06T00:00Z-03:00Z. This minor enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR around 2024-05-05T11:30Z which is associated with a possible glancing blow from the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO imagery at 2024-05-03T02:48Z (see notification 20240503-AL-003) followed by a coronal hole high speed stream starting on 2024-05-06.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this reporting period due to the geomagnetic activity described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location

and high levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently six active regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13663 (N25W68) and 13664 (S20W20) were responsible for 40 of the M-class flares and all of the X-class flares during the reporting period. Active Region 13664 is expected to continue moderate to high levels of flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Active Region 13663 is expected to rotate off of the Earth-facing disk on 2024-05-10, but is likely to still produce significant flares in the next couple of days. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low to strong levels during the outlook period. Enhanced geomagnetic activity is expected starting on 2024-05-10 through 2024-05-11 due to the anticipated combined arrival of today's C-type halo CME first seen in SOHO LASCO imagery at 2024-05-08T05:36Z associated with the X1.0 class flare from Active Region 13664 and the C-type halo CME first seen in SOHO LASCO imagery at 2024-05-08T12:24Z associated with the M8.6 class flare from Active Region 13664. Further enhancement of geomagnetic activity is possible starting on 2024-05-12 from four coronal holes seen currently on the Earth-facing disk centered near (N07E27), (S35E10), (N25E05), and (N17W14). \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240508-AL-012","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/30592/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-05-08T18:43Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Lucy, STEREO A, Parker Solar Probe, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-05-08T18:43:52Z\n## Message ID: 20240508-AL-012\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The flank of the CMEs will reach STEREO A at 2024-05-07T20:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). \n  \nThe simulation also indicates that the CMEs may have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth. Simulations indicate that the flank of the CMEs will reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2024-05-07T23:00Z (plus minus 7 hours).

The highest value of Kp=5.33 occurred during the synoptic period 2024-04-26T15:00Z-18:00Z. This minor geomagnetic activity was associated with the glancing blow of one or more CMEs detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR as early as 2024-04-26T00:17Z, which may be associated with S-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-04-23T09:12Z and the S-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-04-24T01:48Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt briefly crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2024-04-24T15:45Z (see notifications 20240424-AL-001 and 20240424-AL-002) and again on 2024-04-25, but subsided to near background levels by 2024-04-26. This brief elevation of energetic electron flux levels was associated with the arrival of the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-04-15T06:48Z two reporting periods ago (see notifications 20240415-AL-002 and 20240417-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this reporting period due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-04-24  00:13:00  00:38:00  00:29:00   M1.7   S10W61 ( 13645 ) \n2024-04-24  00:38:00  00:46:00  00:42:00   M1.6   S09W65 ( 13645 ) \n2024-04-24  02:30:00  02:44:00  02:39:00   M1.8   S17W64 ( 13638 ) \n2024-04-24  12:07:00  12:39:00  12:14:00   M1.4   S07W70 ( 13645 ) \n2024-04-24  22:27:00  22:54:00  22:50:00   M1.1   S12W60 ( 13643 ) \n2024-04-24  22:54:00  23:05:00  22:59:00   M2.0   S11W80 ( 13645 ) \n2024-04-25  01:40:00  02:01:00  01:49:00   M1.0   S11E75 ( 13645 ) \n2024-04-25  02:39:00  02:46:00  02:43:00   M1.0   S13W64 ( 13647 ) \n2024-04-25  03:05:00  03:35:00  03:15:00   M1.0   S12W72 ( 13645 ) \n2024-04-25  13:11:00  13:27:00  13:21:00   M1.0   S19W90 ( 13638 ) \n2024-04-25  17:03:00  17:16:00  17:12:00   M1.3   S19W88 ( 13638 ) \n2024-04-27  12:23:00  12:44:00  12:35:00   M2.1   S08W15 ( 13654 ) \n2024-04-27  21:29:00  21:49:00  21:40:00   M3.0   S07W20 ( 13654 ) \n2024-04-29  00:33:00  00:54:00  00:48:00   M2.5   S07W38 ( 13654 ) \n2024-04-29  00:54:00  01:20:00  01:11:00   M3.7   S07W37 ( 13654 ) \n2024-04-30  00:46:00  01:31:00  01:14:00   M1.6   S07W54 ( 13654 ) \n2024-04-30  14:50:00  15:26:00  15:11:00   M1.2   S07W62 ( 13654 ) \n2024-04-30  16:11:00  16:47:00  16:33:00   M1.3   S07W60 ( 13654 ) \n2024-04-30  23:23:00  23:58:00  23:46:00   M9.5   S06W63 ( 13654 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nNONE\n\nNon-Earth directed (POS = Plane Of Sky):\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-04-24T06:48Z     ~801            C               -95/31                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-04-25T10:48Z     ~1098           O               -83/13                28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-04-26T00:24Z     ~583            C               -90/0                 32                          SOHO                              \n2024-04-27T23:12Z     ~605            C               -90/20                23                          SOHO                              \n2024-04-28T03:48Z     ~738            C              -118/-70               16                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-04-30T02:36Z     ~513            C               126/-45               26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-05-01T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-05-07T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between moderate to high levels in the outlook period. Currently, there are six numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13654 (S07W75) has produced several M-class flares towards the end of the reporting period and will likely continue to exhibit notable flaring activity as it rotates off the Earth-facing disk on or around 2024-05-03.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. An ongoing enhancement in the solar wind initially detected by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-04-30T11:30Z could result in slightly elevated geomagnetic activity during the beginning of the outlook period. A coronal hole currently centered around N13W05 spanning longitudes from E07 to W18 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-05-03. A fainter coronal hole structure currently centered around S35W01 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-05-05. Additionally, a third coronal hole currently centered around S10E18 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-05-07.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240501-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/30365/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-05-01T16:47Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Parker Solar Probe, Lucy, Mars, OSIRIS-APEX, STEREO A)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-05-01T16:47:29Z\n## Message ID: 20240501-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
