This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate levels during this reporting period with two M-class flares, one O-type, and two C-type CMEs (see details below). Both M-class flares (M2.8 class flare peaking at 2021-09-23T04:42Z and M1.8 class flare peaking at 2021-09-23T15:28Z) originated from Active Region 12871 and were associated with two S-type CMEs. The O-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-09-26T03:12Z was not predicted to impact any NASA missions. \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-09-28T07:00Z may affect STEREO B at 2021-10-01T03:25Z and have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth at 2021-10-01T10:30Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20210928-AL-001). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 2-3 (below minor). Additionally, an ensemble model was carried out for this CME. Its leading edge is estimated to reach STEREO B between about 2021-09-30T20:37Z and 2021-10-01T16:03Z (average arrival 2021-10-01T02:25Z) for 100% of simulations and its flank is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-09-30T16:24Z and 2021-10-01T09:03Z (average arrival 2021-10-01T01:29Z) for 87% of simulations (see notification 20210929-AL-001). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2021-09-22T00:00Z-03:00Z, 2021-09-22T06:00Z-09:00Z and 2021-09-23T06:00Z-09:00Z. These slightly elevated values of Kp were associated with a small coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-09-21 which resulted in solar wind speeds reaching values around 410 km/s on 2021-09-22. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt briefly crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu on 2021-09-23T15:35Z due to the above mentioned high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-09-21 (see notifications 20210923-AL-001 and 20210923-AL-002). The fluxes went back to nominal levels on 2021-09-24.  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate due to elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2021-09-23  04:20:00  17:16:00  04:42:00   M2.8   S22E28 ( 12871 ) \n2021-09-23  15:23:00  15:39:00  15:28:00   M1.8   S28E16 ( 12871 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-09-28T07:00Z     ~649            C                43/-17               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-09-24T17:24Z     ~503            C                15/-21               10                          SOHO, STEREO A \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)                  \n2021-09-26T03:12Z     ~1164           O                98/-20               18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-09-29T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-10-05T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary from minor to possibly moderate levels in the upcoming week. Seven numbered active regions are currently on the Earth facing disk: 12877, 12878, 12880, 12881, as well as 12871, 12872 and 12876 which will be soon rotating off the Earth facing disk. Two more yet unnamed active regions have just rotated onto the Earth facing disk. Active regions 12871 and more recently 12880 have been producing B and C-class flares, and active region 12871 was responsible for numerous CMEs in the reporting period and this activity might continue during the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels for the upcoming week due to the predicted glancing blow at L1 on 2021-10-01 of the C-type CME initially observed by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-09-28T07:00Z. An equatorial coronal hole that first rotated onto the STEREO A facing disk on 2021-09-26 may possibly affect STEREO-A around 2021-10-04.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20210929-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/17853/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-09-29T12:43Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (ensemble) (STEREO B, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-09-29T12:43:59Z\n## Message ID: 20210929-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO B between about 2021-09-30T20:37Z and 2021-10-01T16:03Z (average arrival 2021-10-01T02:25Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-09-30T16:24Z and 2021-10-01T09:03Z (average arrival 2021-10-01T01:29Z) for 87% of simulations.

There were 5 C-type CMEs (see details below). Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first seen at 2021-09-15T05:00Z may have a minor impact to Parker Solar Probe at 2021-09-17T18:00Z, a minor impact to Solar Orbiter at 2021-09-17T02:00Z, and a glancing blow to STEREO A at 2021-09-18T16:00Z (plus/minus 7 hours). It was also estimated that the C-type CME first seen at 2021-09-18T03:12Z was estimated to impact OSIRIS-REx at 2021-09-21T22:58Z and a glancing blow to Mars at 2021-09-23T09:30Z (plus/minus 7 hours). Also, it was estimated that the C-type CME first seen at 2021-09-18T14:53Z may have a glancing blow to Parker Solar Probe at 2021-09-20T18:00Z and a glancing blow to Solar Orbiter at 2021-09-20T05:30Z (plus/minus 7 hours) (see notification 20210918-AL-001). \n\nOn 2021-09-17T16:40Z STEREO A IMPACT detected the arrival of the above mentioned C-type CME first seen by SOHO LASCO C2 on 2021-09-15T05:00Z.\n\nGeomagnetic activity reached minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods 2021-09-17T18:00Z-24:00Z. This slightly elevated value of Kp was caused by the significant interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2021-09-17T01:29Z associated with the arrival of the CME first visible on 2021-09-13Z10:36Z (see notification 20210917-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-09-15T05:00Z     ~511            C               -61/-30               22                          SOHO                              \n2021-09-17T04:28Z     ~994            C              -100/-41               24                          SOHO                              \n2021-09-18T03:12Z     ~681            C               158/30                42                          SOHO                              \n2021-09-18T14:53Z     ~766            C               -24/-29               19                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2021-09-19T05:24Z     ~675            C               116/-10               28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-09-22T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-09-28T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels for the upcoming week. There are five numbered and two unnumbered active regions visible on the Earth-facing disk. Active regions 12871, 12872, 12873, and newly numbered active region 12875 have produced multiple B-class flares with active regions 12871 and 12873 producing a few C-class flares during the reporting period. These active regions may continue to produce B and C-class flares throughout the outlook period. There are potentially three unnumbered active regions on the STEREO A-facing disk that are not currently visible on the Earth-facing disk. Two of these regions are located beyond the eastern limb from STEREO A's point of view while the third is located close to the eastern limb of the Earth-facing disk. These three unnumbered active regions may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk during the first half of the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels for the upcoming week due to the anticipated arrival of a high speed stream at L1 as early as 2021-09-24 from the wide equatorial coronal hole that crossed the central meridian on the Earth-facing disk on 2021-09-20.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20210918-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/17776/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-09-18T19:09Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-09-18T19:09:07Z\n## Message ID: 20210918-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were no significant flares and only 2 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CMEs first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-09-11T08:24Z and at 2021-09-11T09:12Z may impact Mars (glancing blow) and OSIRIS-REx (glancing blow). The flank of the combined CMEs is predicted to reach Mars at 2021-09-17T00:00Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2021-09-15T16:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods 2021-09-08T00:00Z-03:00Z, 2021-09-08T09:00Z-12:00Z, and 2021-09-10T21:00Z-24:00Z. The slightly elevated value of Kp on 2021-09-08 was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-09-07. Solar wind speeds from this event reached values around 430 km/s on 2021-09-08. The slightly elevated value of Kp on 2021-09-10 was associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2021-09-10T01:32Z of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-09-05T21:36Z (see notifications 20210907-AL-001, 20210908-AL-001, and 20210910-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-09-11T08:24Z     ~652            C              -117/-29               39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-09-11T09:12Z     ~577            C              -148/-26               29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-09-15T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-09-21T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels.

Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model for 48 ensemble members for this CME predicted that the leading edge will reach STEREO A between about 2021-09-09T05:38Z and 2021-09-09T14:41Z (average arrival 2021-09-09T10:25Z) for 12% of simulations, STEREO B between about 2021-09-08T22:40Z and 2021-09-09T16:33Z (average arrival 2021-09-09T05:21Z) for 6% of simulations, and NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-09-08T18:49Z and 2021-09-10T08:39Z (average arrival 2021-09-09T12:06Z) for 77% of simulations (see notification 20210908-AL-001). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at low levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 3 for the reporting period. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu first at 2021-09-01T09:00Z (see notifications 20210830-AL-001, 20210901-AL-001, and 20210903-AL-001). These elevated energetic electron flux levels were associated with a weak coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-08-29. The threshold level of 1000 pfu was crossed again at 2021-09-05T13:10Z (see notification 20210905-AL-001) possibly associated with the arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-09-03T06:19Z of the CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-08-28T07:00Z. Later, the threshold level of 1000 pfu was crossed once again at 2021-09-07T17:45Z (see notification 20210907-AL-002) likely caused by a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-09-07.  The solar wind speed reached a maximum speed of approximately 440 km/s on 2021-09-08.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-09-05T21:36Z     ~537            C                 0/7                 45                          SOHO  \n                   \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-09-01T00:12Z     ~631            C                74/-7                38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-09-02T09:36Z     ~566            C                99/-17               16                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-09-04T19:24Z     ~632            C               145/-39               31                          SOHO                              \n2021-09-06T11:38Z     ~557            C               117/-12               22                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-09-08T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-09-14T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels for the upcoming week.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate levels during this reporting period with one M-class flare, eight C-type CMEs, and one O-type CME (see details below). The M4.7 class flare originated from Active Region 12860 located at S28E00 and peaked at 2021-08-28T06:11Z. An associated S-type CME was first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-08-28T07:00Z. \n \nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-08-26T18:53Z may potentially impact Parker Solar Probe at 2021-08-28T05:14Z, STEREO A at 2021-08-29T08:42Z, and NASA missions near Earth at 2021-08-29T18:51Z (plus/minus 7 hours) (see notification 20210827-AL-002). Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model for 48 ensemble members for this CME predicted that the leading edge will reach STEREO A between about 2021-08-28T16:17Z and 2021-08-29T14:51Z (average arrival 2021-08-29T03:34Z) for 85% of simulations, STEREO B between about 2021-08-29T11:26Z and 2021-08-29T20:35Z (average arrival 2021-08-29T16:29Z) for 14% of simulations, and NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-08-28T23:30Z and 2021-08-30T05:58Z (average arrival 2021-08-29T13:20Z) for 95% of simulations (see notification 20210828-AL-002).  No significant arrival has been detected at missions near Earth, but the observed data is still under analysis. \n\nSTEREO A IMPACT detected the arrival of two CMEs.  The first arrival was detected after a data gap around 2021-08-30T11:00Z possibly from the S-type CME first seen on 2021-08-26T03:36Z followed by the arrival on 2021-08-30T16:00Z of the C-type CME described above.  It was also estimated that the C-type CME first visible on 2021-08-28T13:25Z (simulated together with the CME first visible on 2021-08-28T07:00Z) had an anticipated glancing blow at STEREO B on 2021-08-31T12:00Z (plus/minus 7 hours). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic period 2021-08-28T00:00Z-03:00Z. This slightly elevated value of Kp was caused by the significant interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2021-08-27T11:42Z associated with the CME first visible on 2021-08-24Z13:25Z (see notification 20210827-AL-001). This shock signature was preceded by the arrival detected around 2021-08-27T00:25Z of the S-type CME that was first visible on 2021-08-23T06:36Z. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu at 2021-08-28T02:05Z (see notifications 20210828-AL-001 and 20210828-AL-003). These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the combined arrivals detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-08-27T00:25Z and 2021-08-27T11:42Z of the S-type CMEs first seen by SOHO LASCO on 2021-08-23Z06:36Z and 2021-08-24T13:25Z, respectively. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu again at 2021-08-30T05:20Z (see notification 20210830-AL-001). These elevated energetic electron flux levels are likely caused by a weak coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-08-29, reaching a maximum speed of approximately 441 km/s. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2021-08-28  05:39:00  06:23:00  06:11:00   M4.7   S28E00 (12860) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-08-26T18:53Z     ~599            C               -20/12                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                                       \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-08-28T13:25Z     ~777            C                72/-12               29                          SOHO, STEREO A \n2021-08-28T21:48Z     ~638            C                88/-31               18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-08-29T20:24Z     ~864            C                91/-31               14                          SOHO                              \n2021-08-29T20:48Z     ~1128           O               110/-10               26                          SOHO                              \n2021-08-30T02:12Z     ~740            C                99/-29               17                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2021-08-30T20:48Z     ~661            C               100/-17               14                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2021-08-31T01:36Z     ~624            C               109/-18               11                          SOHO\n2021-08-31T13:09Z     ~731            C               105/-15               37                          SOHO, STEREO A\n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-09-01T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-09-07T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels for the upcoming week. Active regions 12859, 12860, and 12861 are visible on the Earth-facing disk. Active region 12861 has decayed to a plage as of 2021-08-30. Active region 12860 produced the M4.7 class flare and C-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to produce flares early in the outlook period. Active regions 12859 and 12860 will rotate off the Earth-facing disk around 2021-09-03. One unnumbered active region is visible in the northeast of STEREO A EUVI 195 and began rotating onto the Earth-facing disk on 2021-09-01.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary from low to minor levels for the outlook period.  We are expecting the arrival of the S-type CME seen at SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-08-28T07:00Z that is predicted to impact NASA missions near Earth on 2021-09-02T00:00Z (plus/minus 7 hours).  The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES has been near or at elevated levels since 2021-08-28 due to the S-type CMEs and the coronal hole high speed stream described above and may continue to be elevated throughout the outlook period. The high-speed stream from the equatorial coronal hole that appears near central meridian on 2021-09-01 on the Earth facing-disk may become geoeffective around 2021-09-05.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20210901-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/17644/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-09-01T12:15Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-09-01T12:15:15Z\n## Message ID: 20210901-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
