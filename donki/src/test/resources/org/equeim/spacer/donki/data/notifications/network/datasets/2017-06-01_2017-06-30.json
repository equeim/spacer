There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.

This minor enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 on 2017-06-16.  The solar wind speed reached values of >600 km/s at the end of 2017-06-16.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-06-17T19:25Z and remained elevated crossing the threshold again on 2017-06-19T15:20Z. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above (see notifications 20170617-AL-001, 20170617-AL-002, and 20170619-AL-001).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the enhancement on the energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-06-20T06:48Z     ~530            C               -84/16                33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-06-21T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-06-27T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate.

Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week due the possible impact of this eruption, but more analysis and images are needed to see if a coronal mass ejection was produced and evaluate its possible impact.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

No CMEs with a speed above 500 km/s where detected in the available coronagraph imagery.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at strong levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=7 for the reporting period. This strong increase in geomagnetic activity was due to the CME arrival detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2017-05-27T14:47Z (see notification 20170527-AL-001). The CME was first observed on the coronagraph imagery around 2017-05-23T05:00Z (see notification 20170523-AL-002). Kp first reached values of 6 during the synoptic periods of 2017-05-27T21:00Z to 2017-05-28T03:00Z and 2017-05-28T06:00Z to 2017-05-28T09:00Z. The peak for geomagnetic activity with Kp=7 occurred in the synoptic period 2017-05-28T03:00Z to 2017-05-28T06:00Z (see notifications 20170528-AL-001, 20170528-AL-002, 20170528-AL-003).\n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES continued to be above the threshold level of 10^5 pfu. This increase started at 2017-05-21T12:25Z and the threshold was crossed several times since then up to the arrival of the CME mentioned above (see notifications 20170521-AL-001, 20170521-AL-002, 20170523-AL-001, 20170525-AL-001). The elevated energetic electron flux levels are associated with a coronal hole high speed stream starting at 2017-05-19T18:08Z.  Solar wind speed reached values of >700 km/s on 2017-05-20.  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux on the Earth's outer radiation belt and the CME arrival described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nSolar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week. There are 2 active regions currently visible on the Earth's facing side and two more are expected to rotate on, and all of them show low to moderate activity with some chance of producing solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.  A minor coronal hole high speed stream is expected later in the coming week due to a small equatorial coronal hole observed close to disk center on 2017-05-30.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
