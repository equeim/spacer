This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate levels during this reporting period.  There were 2 C-type CMEs, 1 R-type CME(see details below). The CMEs with starting times 2017-07-23T01:36Z and 2017-07-23T04:39Z launched very close to each other and merged into one CME propagating away from the sun, with very high speed. Simulations carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center indicated that the combinded CME would impact STEREO B, missions at Mars, the Dawn spacecraft and have a flank impact at STEREO A (see notifications 20170723-AL-003 and 20170724-AL-002). An interplanetary shock was detected by STEREO A at 2017-07-24T18:00Z, with the total magnetic field reaching > 60nT and B_z > 50 nT (note, real-time STEREO A solar wind data has data gaps, so the actual values could be even higher).\n\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at low to moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.\nKp=5 was reached during the synoptic period 2017-07-22T09:00Z - 2017-07-22T12:00Z, which was associated with a high speed stream arriving at Earth on 2017-07-20T12:00:00.\n\n\nThe 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-07-24T15:05Z. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream arrival described above (see notifications 20170724-AL-001 and 20170724-AL-003).  \n\n\nA solar energetic particle event was detected by STEREO A: the flux of 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2017-07-23T10:19Z (see notifications 20170723-AL-001 and 20170723-AL-002). This event was associated with the fast CMEs mentioned above (2017-07-23T01:36Z and 2017-07-23T04:39:00Z).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES was at background levels for most of the reporting period. At around 2017-07-25T12:00Z a slight increase was measured, most likely due to the fast CMEs mentioned above, although the flux levels remained below the threshold.\n\n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been high this week with the impact of the fast CMEs heading towards STEREO A, B, Mars and Dawn and the SEP event also connected to this CME. Missions at Earth are expected to have been impacted by the significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-07-20T18:24Z     ~620            C               121/2                 28                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2017-07-23T01:36Z     ~944            C               154/13                33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2017-07-23T04:39Z     ~2271           R               170/-4                46                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-07-26T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-08-01T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity are expected to be low for the upcoming week. The Earth facing side of the solar disk shows no visible sunspots, EUV images currently show 2 faint active regions, that are quiescent. The active region that had the fast CMEs this week will still be on the far-side, it continues to show some activity and there is some chance of additional eruptions. STEREO A EUV images also show several small coronal holes, which will result in increased solar wind speed in the next few days at STEREO A.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate levels during this reporting period with one M-class flare (see list below).  There were four C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with the Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=6 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2017-07-16T12:00Z-15:00Z, 2017-07-16T18:00Z-21:00Z and 2017-07-17T15:00Z-18:00Z.  The increased Kp on 2017-07-16 was associated with the 2017-17-14T01:36Z CME arrival detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2017-07-16T05:14Z (see notifications 20170714-AL-003, 20170714-AL-004, 20170716-AL-003, and 20170716-AL-004).  Simulations carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center indicated that the CME arrival also caused that the magnetopause boundary separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit around 2017-07-16T11:23Z (see notifications 20170716-AL-001 and 20170716-AL-002).  The geomagnetic activity on 2017-07-17 was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream at the tail end of the CME arrival on 2017-07-16.  Solar wind speeds reached values of >650 km/s on 2017-07-16 and remained elevated for several days.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-07-16T15:45Z.  These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the combined effects of the CME and the coronal hole high speed stream arrivals described above (see notifications 20170717-AL-001 and 20170717-AL-002).  \n\nThe flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2017-07-14T09:00Z.  This solar energetic particle event detected by GOES was associated with the M2.4 class flare that peaked at 2017-07-14T02:09Z (see details below) and the 2017-07-14T01:36Z CME (see notifications 20170714-AL-001 and 20170714-AL-002).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A was at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due the the solar energetic particle event and the increased energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2017-07-14  01:07:00  03:24:00  02:09:00   M2.4   S09W33 ( 12665 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-07-14T01:36Z     ~750            C                40/-9                49                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-07-13T20:48Z     ~573            C                40/-3                22                          SOHO                              \n2017-07-15T11:12Z     ~734            C                65/9                 10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2017-07-15T21:24Z     ~589            C                59/9                 39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-07-19T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-07-25T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming reporting period.   Active region 12665 has already rotated off the west limb as seen from SDO imagery, but could still produce coronal mass ejections.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  A minor disturbance is possible on 2017-07-20 to 07-21 from a large coronal hole located in the Sun's northern hemisphere.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

ENSEMBLE PRODUCT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT MODE. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on the CME with ID 2017-07-14T01:36:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20170714-AL-003). \n\nBased on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth. Out of 48 ensemble members (see notes section), 47 (97%) indicate impact at NASA missions near Earth. Ensemble simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2017-07-16T04:38Z and 2017-07-17T04:36Z (average arrival 2017-07-16T16:51Z). The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 74% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-07-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX062/20170714_013600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX062_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-07-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX062/20170714_013600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX062_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-07-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX062/20170714_013600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX062_Earth_stack.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-07-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX062/20170714_013600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX062_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at SWRC is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2017-07-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX062/Detailed_results_20170714_013600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX062.txt\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it was estimated that the CME (S-type) starting on 2017-06-28T15:24Z would impact Spitzer (glancing blow) around 2017-07-02T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours).  The simulation also indicated that the CME (S-type) starting on 2017-06-28T16:24Z CME may have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth around 2017-07-02T19:30Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20170629-AL-001).  There was a weak CME arrival detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2017-07-01T16:26Z attributed to the 2017-06-28 CME.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2017-07-02T06:00Z-09:00Z. This slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with the CME arrival detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 described above.  \n\nSTEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-07-01.  Solar wind speed reached values of ~500 km/s.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2017-07-03  15:37:00  16:18:00  16:15:00   M1.3   N03W89      \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-07-04T09:36Z     ~900            C              -105/11                12                          SOHO                              \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-07-05T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-07-11T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming reporting period.  There are a couple active regions currently on the far side that are capable of producing solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Geomagnetic activity is expected to be moderate for the upcoming week due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-07-08.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
