The highest value of Kp <= 7.00 occurred during the synoptic period 2024-04-19T18:00Z to 2024-04-19T21:00Z (see notifications 20240419-AL-002 and 20240420-AL-001). This strong enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2024-04-19T04:53Z (see notification 20240419-AL-001) which was associated with the arrival of the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-04-15T06:48Z during the previous reporting period (see notifications 20240415-AL-002 and 20240417-AL-001).\n\nThe >2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the geomagnetic activity described above. \n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-04-17

Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-04-24T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-04-30T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between moderate to high levels during the outlook period with fifteen numbered active regions currently on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13638 (S18W77) and 13645 (S08W76) produced several of the M-class flares observed during the reporting period and will likely continue to exhibit notable flaring activity as they rotate off the Earth-facing disk on or around 2024-04-26. Active Region 13654 (S08E18) and Active Region 13656 (S12E33) may also continue to produce flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Two coronal holes currently centered around S03W35 and N45W40 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-04-24. Additionally, a coronal hole currently centered around S34E05 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-04-28. The >2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES recently crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2024-04-24T15:45Z (see notifications 20240424-AL-001 and 20240424-AL-002). This radiation belt enhancement is associated with the arrival of the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-04-15T06:48Z (see notifications 20240415-AL-002 and 20240417-AL-001) which was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2024-04-19T04:53Z (see notification 20240419-AL-001). The >2.0 MeV electron flux is likely to remain elevated throughout the outlook period.\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240424-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/30260/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-04-24T17:45Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (Lucy, Mars, OSIRIS-APEX, Parker Solar Probe, STEREO A)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-04-24T17:45:30Z\n## Message ID: 20240424-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This minor geomagnetic activity is associated with the CME arrival detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2024-04-16T09:20Z which is associated with the arrival of the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-04-12T02:00Z (see notifications 20240412-AL-001 and 20240413-AL-001). \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period.

There are numerous numbered Active Regions currently on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13639 (N29E25) and 13637 (S13E16) produced several M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Active Region 13634 (N26W67) may also continue to exhibit flaring activity early within the outlook period before it rotates off the Earth-facing disk on or around 2024-04-18.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor to strong levels during the outlook period. There may be an enhancement in geomagnetic activity early in the outlook period on or around 2024-04-17 due to the anticipated arrival of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-04-15T06:48Z. A small coronal hole centered at S10W05 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-04-20.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240417-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/30115/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-04-17T20:12Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Parker Solar Probe)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-04-17T20:12:03Z\n## Message ID: 20240417-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

ENSEMBLE PRODUCT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT MODE. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CMEs with IDs 2024-04-14T11:12:00-CME-001 and 2024-04-15T06:48:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20240415-AL-002). Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME with ID 2024-04-14T11:12:00-CME-001 may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2024-04-16T16:10Z and 2024-04-17T08:22Z (average arrival 2024-04-17T01:26Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-04-16T17:15Z and 2024-04-17T07:52Z (average arrival 2024-04-17T01:09Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 95% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-7 range (below minor to strong).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-16_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061/20240414_111200_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-16_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061/20240414_111200_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-16_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061/20240414_111200_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-16_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061/20240414_111200_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-16_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061/20240414_111200_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThe two CMEs in this simulation did not combine prior to impacting STEREO A and Earth, leading to a double peaked arrival in the STEREO A and Earth timelines. The second CME (2024-04-15T06:48Z) may impact STEREO A around 2024-04-17T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) and Earth around 2024-04-17T15:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on visual inspection of the simulation output.\n\nAdditionally, the combined flank of the CMEs were also predicted to impact Lucy at 2024-04-21T00:00Z (glancing blow) and Psyche at 2024-04-21T18:00Z (glancing blow) (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20240415-AL-002).  \n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-16_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061/Detailed_results_20240414_111200_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061.txt\n###\n\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240416-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/30093/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-04-16T15:16Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Psyche)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-04-16T15:16:28Z\n## Message ID: 20240416-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME with ID 2024-04-12T02:00:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20240412-AL-001).Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2024-04-14T06:49Z and 2024-04-14T15:24Z (average arrival 2024-04-14T11:08Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-04-14T11:17Z and 2024-04-14T20:14Z (average arrival 2024-04-14T15:43Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 65% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060/20240412_020000_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060/20240412_020000_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060/20240412_020000_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060/20240412_020000_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060/20240412_020000_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2024-04-12T02:00:00-CME-001) is also predicted to impact Lucy at 2024-04-17T00:00Z (glancing blow) and Psyche at 2024-04-19T06:00Z (glancing blow) (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20240412-AL-001).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060/Detailed_results_20240412_020000_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060.txt\n###\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240412-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/30026/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-04-12T19:30Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Mars, OSIRIS-APEX, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-04-12T19:30:28Z\n## Message ID: 20240412-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There are currently four numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13629 (currently located at N05W90) produced numerous C-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit flaring activity before rotating off the Earth-facing disk on 2024-04-10. Additionally, newly numbered Active Region 13635 (currently located near N20E58) may also produce flaring activity throughout the outlook period. It is also possible that previously numbered Active Region 13615, which was responsible for numerous M-class flares observed during prior reporting periods, may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk once again during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Two coronal holes currently centered around S27E03 and N30W01, as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA, may become geoeffective on or around 2024-04-13. Additionally, a coronal hole currently centered around N35E25 may become geoeffective on or around 2024-04-15. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES may become elevated during the first half of the outlook period due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2024-04-04, which reached a maximum sustained speed of 550 km/s.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240406-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/29943/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-04-06T15:15Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-APEX, Mars, Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-04-06T15:15:32Z\n## Message ID: 20240406-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

At the beginning of the reporting period, the particle environment was somewhat elevated (but below thresholds) after a solar energetic particle event detected by SOHO, GOES, and STEREO A in the previous reporting period (see report 20240320-7D-001). The energetic particle fluxes at all three locations have since decreased to background levels.   \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this reporting period.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-03-27  01:37:00  01:52:00  01:44:00   M1.1   S10W45 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-27  06:33:00  06:50:00  06:41:00   M1.1   S13W44 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-28  06:16:00  06:36:00  06:29:00   M7.0   S15W53 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-28  15:40:00  16:03:00  15:56:00   M6.1   S15W55 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-28  19:21:00  19:38:00  19:31:00   M1.1   S15W57 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-28  20:29:00  20:50:00  20:46:00   M9.7   S14W60 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-28  20:50:00  21:01:00  20:56:00   X1.1   S14W60 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-29  02:17:00  02:42:00  02:30:00   M3.2   S16W63 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-29  18:22:00  18:57:00  18:43:00   M1.0   S13W75 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-29  19:19:00  19:56:00  19:34:00   M1.2   S15W72 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-30  21:01:00  22:15:00  21:16:00   M9.4   S13W92 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-30  22:49:00  23:07:00  22:53:00   M4.5   S13W93 ( 13615 ) \n2024-04-01  01:13:00  01:57:00  01:32:00   M3.9   S13W108 ( 13615 )\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nNONE\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-03-27T01:36Z     ~518            C               117/4                 45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-30T23:12Z     ~640            C               -65/53                31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-04-01T03:48Z     ~526            C              -117/73                29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-04-01T08:25Z     ~660            C              -107/82                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-04-03T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-04-09T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at minor levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently 4 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13615, which was responsible for all of the X and M-class flares observed during the last reporting period (and for the vast majority of significant flares in the two preceding reporting periods) has by now rotated far beyond the western limb.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. There may be a slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity during the first half of the outlook period on or around 2024-04-04 due to the anticipated arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream associated with the coronal hole which crossed the central meridian on 2024-03-31 and is currently stretched along a longitude of ~40 degrees (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA).\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"}]
