This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low levels during this reporting period.  There were 9 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, the following CME impacts were estimated:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2022-11-26T11:53Z    Parker Solar Probe at 2022-11-27T19:56Z (see notification 20221126-AL-001)\n2022-11-27T17:38Z    Parker Solar Probe at 2022-11-28T22:30Z (see notification 20221127-AL-003)\n2022-11-28T21:36Z    Parker Solar Probe at 2022-11-30T04:29Z (see notification 20221129-AL-001)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5.33 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=5.33 occurred during the synoptic period of 2022-11-28T03:00Z-06:00Z.  This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the detected arrival by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2022-11-27 with an associated interplanetary shock detected at 2022-11-27T17:03Z (see notification 20221128-AL-001). \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2022-11-27T13:45Z. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-11-24. The solar wind reached a maximum sustained speeds of over 620 km/s on 2022-11-26 (see notifications 20221124-AL-001, 20221127-AL-001 and 20221127-AL-002). Later on, the electrons were elevated and crossed the threshold a second time starting at 2022-11-29T13:55Z.  This second increase may have been associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream around 2022-11-27 mentioned above.  The solar wind speed reached values of 700 km/s on 2022-11-29 and 2022-11-30 (see notifications 20221128-AL-001 and 20221129-AL-002).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-11-23T01:25Z     ~774            C                25/-58               13                          SOHO                              \n2022-11-24T17:48Z     ~507            C               -37/-26               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-11-25T09:53Z     ~638            C                30/-60               10                          STEREO A                          \n2022-11-25T22:38Z     ~683            C                90/29                37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-11-26T11:53Z     ~551            C               -87/19                20                          STEREO A                          \n2022-11-27T17:38Z     ~552            C               -93/-4                30                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-11-28T11:00Z     ~757            C               172/9                 11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-11-28T21:36Z     ~525            C               -75/-37               40                          SOHO                              \n2022-11-29T12:12Z     ~667            C              -176/-56               24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-11-30T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-12-06T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to minor for the upcoming week. There is only one active region present on the Earth's facing disk. However, this active region has remained active producing B and C class flares through the reporting period and can remain active for the next several days.  There are two unumbered active regions seen in the STEREO A imagery that will be rotating to the Earth facing disk around 2022-12-01.\n\nThe geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming reporting period. There is a coronal hole currently located at N02W30 that will may become geoeffective around 2022-12-01.  \n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20221129-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22563/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-11-29T14:21Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-11-29T14:21:26Z\n## Message ID: 20221129-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There are four numbered active regions in the Earth's facing disk.  Active region 13151 just developed on the Earth facing disk around 2022-11-21 and it has been the most active in the last few days producing several C class flares, one of them associated with one of the CMEs mentioned above. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be low to minor for the upcoming week.  There are several small coronal holes that may become geoeffective in the next few days. The first one is located around N20W35 that can cause a slight enhancement in the Earth environment around 2022-11-24.  The second one is located currently close to the central meridian and may become geoeffective around 2022-11-28.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20221122-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22442/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-11-22T22:31Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (ensemble) (STEREO A, Mars, STEREO B, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-11-22T22:31:01Z\n## Message ID: 20221122-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A, STEREO B, and Mars. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2022-11-24T23:05Z and 2022-11-25T10:59Z (average arrival 2022-11-25T05:41Z) for 85% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2022-11-25T05:29Z and 2022-11-25T23:06Z (average arrival 2022-11-25T14:47Z) for 97% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2022-11-26T21:59Z and 2022-11-27T13:26Z (average arrival 2022-11-27T07:47Z) for 62% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-11-25T02:59Z and 2022-11-25T19:35Z (average arrival 2022-11-25T11:40Z) for 97% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 96% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-22_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159/20221122_080000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-22_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159/20221122_080000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-22_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159/20221122_080000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-22_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159/20221122_080000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-22_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159/20221122_080000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-22_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159/20221122_080000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159_Mars_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-22_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159/20221122_080000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-22_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159/20221122_080000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159_STA_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-22_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159/20221122_080000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-22_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159/20221122_080000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event is also predicted to arrive at Solar Orbiter at 2022-11-24T14:32Z (plus minus 7 hours), based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20221122-AL-001).\n\nThis CME event (2022-11-22T08:00:00-CME-001) is associated with C7.0 flare with ID 2022-11-22T06:59:00-FLR-001 from Active Region 13151 which peaked at 2022-11-22T07:27Z.\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-22_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159/Detailed_results_20221122_080000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX159.txt\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20221122-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22439/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-11-22T19:33Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Parker Solar Probe)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-11-22T19:33:13Z\n## Message ID: 20221122-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A, STEREO B, and Mars. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2022-11-22T01:29Z and 2022-11-22T12:47Z (average arrival 2022-11-22T07:08Z) for 8% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2022-11-21T21:29Z and 2022-11-22T07:59Z (average arrival 2022-11-22T04:05Z) for 66% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2022-11-23T10:57Z and 2022-11-23T17:43Z (average arrival 2022-11-23T13:52Z) for 12% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-11-21T18:30Z and 2022-11-22T05:42Z (average arrival 2022-11-22T01:20Z) for 58% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 95% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-19_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158/20221119_094800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-19_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158/20221119_094800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-19_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158/20221119_094800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-19_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158/20221119_094800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-19_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158/20221119_094800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-19_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158/20221119_094800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158_Mars_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-19_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158/20221119_094800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-19_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158/20221119_094800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158_STA_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-19_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158/20221119_094800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-19_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158/20221119_094800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nBased on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20221119-AL-001) this CME event (2022-11-19T09:48:00-CME-001) is also predicted to reach Solar Orbiter at 2022-11-21T16:00Z (plus minus 7 hours).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-19_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158/Detailed_results_20221119_094800_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX158.txt\n\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20221119-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22378/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-11-19T20:30Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (STEREO B, Mars, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-11-19T20:30:50Z\n## Message ID: 20221119-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The energetic electron flux subsided to background levels late on 2022-11-11 and remained at background levels for the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the effects of the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-11-11  07:00:00  07:20:00  07:14:00   M1.2   N12W05 ( 13141 ) \n2022-11-11  11:27:00  11:46:00  11:40:00   M1.2   N12W08 ( 13141 ) \n2022-11-12  00:09:00  00:24:00  00:18:00   M1.1   N14W21 ( 13141 ) \n2022-11-15  02:48:00  02:55:00  02:51:00   M1.0   N22W64 ( 13140 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-11-11T17:24Z     ~505            C                -2/-14               22                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-11-09T06:09Z     ~536            C               117/42                15                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-11-12T06:24Z     ~615            C               175/42                10                          SOHO, STEREO A  \n2022-11-14T02:36Z     ~678            C              NONE/-19               1o                               SOHO\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-11-16T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-11-22T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently 4 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13141 (N14W77) has produced several M-class flares during the reporting period, but has remained quiet in the recent days. Active Region 13140 (N25W87) has been responsible for the majority of flares lately including a M1.0-class flare on 2022-11-15. These Active Regions may produce more flaring activity throughout the outlook period before rotating off the Earth-facing disk by approximately 2022-11-17. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor to moderate levels throughout the outlook period.  There may be some minor enhancement in the geomagnetic activity due to the arrival of two S-type CMEs first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-11-13T11:36Z and 2022-11-14T03:24Z, respectively, which are predicted to impact missions near Earth around 2022-11-17. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt is currently below the threshold level of 1000 pfu, but could be enhanced near the end of the outlook period due to the arrival of a large coronal hole currently centered near S35E25 that may reach geoeffective longitudes by 2022-11-20. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20221114-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22287/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-11-14T18:49Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (ensemble) (STEREO B, Mars, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-11-14T18:49:29Z\n## Message ID: 20221114-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B and Mars. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO B between about 2022-11-17T02:17Z and 2022-11-17T21:55Z (average arrival 2022-11-17T13:50Z) for 64% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2022-11-18T17:59Z and 2022-11-19T09:27Z (average arrival 2022-11-19T03:06Z) for 18% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-11-17T03:27Z and 2022-11-17T15:06Z (average arrival 2022-11-17T10:10Z) for 25% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 89% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor to below minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157/20221114_032400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157/20221114_032400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157/20221114_032400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157/20221114_032400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157/20221114_032400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157/20221114_032400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157_Mars_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157/20221114_032400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157/20221114_032400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2022-11-14T03:24:00-CME-001) is associated with C3.3 flare with ID 2022-11-14T02:44:00-FLR-001 which peaked at 2022-11-14T02:49Z.  This CME may also arrive as a glancing blow at STEREO A around 2022-11-17T10:30Z (plus minus 7 hours), based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20221114-AL-001).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-11-14_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157/Detailed_results_20221114_032400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX157.txt\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20221114-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22286/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-11-14T15:57Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (STEREO B, Mars, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-11-14T15:57:28Z\n## Message ID: 20221114-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods 2022-11-03T12:00Z-18:00Z and 2022-11-07T15:00Z-18:00Z. The first elevation in Kp observed on 2022-11-03 was likely associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream first detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-11-02 with an associated interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-11-02T11:45Z (see notification 20221103-AL-001). The maximum sustained solar wind speed observed by DSCOVR at L1 reached approximately 580 km/s. The second elevation in Kp observed on 2022-11-07 was possibly associated with the arrival of a S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-11-03T08:48Z and/or the S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO at 2022-11-04T07:48Z. This arrival was associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2022-11-07T07:40Z (see notification 20221107-AL-003). This arrival is still under analysis. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was enhanced at the beginning of this reporting period due to a threshold crossing during the previous reporting period beginning at 2022-10-29T17:10Z, caused by a coronal hole high speed stream which arrived on 2022-10-28 (see notifications 20221029-AL-001, 20221029-AL-002, 20221031-AL-001, and 20221102-AL-001). Energetic electron flux levels were further enhanced on 2022-11-03, crossing the threshold level of 1000 pfu again at 2022-11-03T12:35Z (see notifications 20221104-AL-001 and 20221106-AL-001). These elevated energetic electron flux levels were likely caused by the additional enhancement of a new coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-11-02.

The most notable of these, Active Region 13141 (N14E39), recently produced a M5.2-class flare (see notification 20221107-AL-002) associated with a S-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-11-07T00:48Z.  This Active Region may produce more flares and eruptive activity throughout the outlook period before rotating off the Earth-facing disk by approximately 2022-11-17. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is generally expected to be at minor levels throughout the outlook period.  The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt is currently below the threshold level of 1000 pfu. There may be some enhancement in the energetic electron flux levels due to the L1 arrival signature on 2022-11-07.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20221107-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22222/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-11-07T13:50Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-11-07T13:50:06Z\n## Message ID: 20221107-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were 5 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the following CMEs were predicted to impact:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2022-10-26T13:23Z    Parker Solar Probe at 2022-10-28T21:49Z and Solar Orbiter at 2022-10-27T18:49Z\n2022-11-01T15:48Z    OSIRIS-REx at 2022-11-04T12:19Z (see notification 20221101-AL-001)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods 2022-10-29T06:00Z-12:00Z. This elevated value of Kp may have been associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-10-28 with the associated interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-10-28T13:58Z (see notification 20221028-AL-001). The maximum sustained solar wind speed observed by DSCOVR at L1 reached approximately 612 km/s. Currently, the solar wind speed is around 530 km/s. STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments detected an interplanetary shock in the previous reporting period at 2022-10-25T23:53Z that may have also been associated with the previously mentioned coronal hole high speed stream.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2022-10-29T17:10Z and remained elevated through the end of the reporting period (see notifications 20221029-AL-001, 20221029-AL-002, and 20221031-AL-001). These elevated electron flux levels are associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream first detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-10-28 mentioned above. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the effects of the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-10-26T04:24Z     ~640            C               -90/-22               13                          SOHO                              \n2022-10-26T13:23Z     ~576            C               -68/13                22                          STEREO A, SOHO\n2022-10-26T21:12Z     ~524            C               NONE/-78              43                          SOHO                    \n2022-10-28T08:09Z     ~930            C              -149/14                16                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-11-01T15:48Z     ~819            C                80/24                35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-11-02T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-11-08T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently 4 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk that have produced low flaring activity. The most notable of these, Active Region 13135 (N25E05), has been the source of B-class and low-level C-class flaring throughout the outlook period. An unnumbered Active Region is visible on the STEREO A eastern limb around latitude N25 and may be expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk on or around 2022-11-04.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt currently remains elevated around or above 1000 pfu, as a result of the lingering effects of the coronal hole high speed stream, and may remain elevated through the beginning of the outlook period (see notification 20221102-AL-001). A coronal hole centered around S05W15 may become geoeffective on or around 2022-11-03.\n \n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20221102-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/22180/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-11-02T17:03Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-11-02T17:03:06Z\n## Message ID: 20221102-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
