This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at minor levels during the reporting period. There were no significant flares or CMEs.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 6 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=6 occurred during the synoptic period 2020-09-27T21:00Z to 2020-09-28T00:00Z. This moderate geomagnetic storm was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 on 2020-09-27. Solar wind speed reached values of about 650 km/s on 2020-09-28.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2020-09-24T15:30Z and stayed elevated throughout the reporting period (see notifications 20200924-AL-001, 20200924-AL-002, 20200926-AL-001, 20200928-AL-003).  These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the arrivals of two coronal hole high speed streams; the first of which arrived on 2020-09-24 and the second on 2020-09-27.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\n\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-09-30T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-10-06T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at low to minor levels for the upcoming week. Active region 2773 should remain visible on the Earth-facing disk for most of the upcoming week with additional active regions appearing on the Earth-facing disk. Geomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low to minor levels as coronal hole structures become less geoeffective over the coming days. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt is expected to remain elevated over the next few days.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low to moderate levels during this reporting period. No Earth-directed CMEs were measured during the reporting period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods 2020-08-28T15:00Z-18:00Z, 2020-08-31T03:00Z-06:00Z and 2020-08-31T:09Z-12:00Z. These minor geomagnetic storms were associated with the arrival of two coronal hole high speed streams detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 respectively around 2020-08-28 and 2020-08-31. Solar wind speed reached values of ~630 km/s on 2020-09-01.\n\nAn S-type CME which started at 2020-08-27T11:00Z as seen in SOHO C2/C3 and STEREO COR2A was observed by STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments to arrive at STEREO-A around 2020-09-01T10:15Z, however the exact timing has been difficult to determine due to an 8-hour data gap preceding the possible arrival signature. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2020-08-30T10:55Z and stayed elevated throughout the reporting period (see notifications 20200830-AL-002 and 20200901-AL-001). These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the aforementioned coronal hole high speed streams. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above and the CME arrival at STEREO-A towards the end of the reporting period.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-09-02T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-09-08T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at low levels for the upcoming week. There is a large filament structure at mid-latitudes of the central disk which, if it erupts, might affect the Earth, but it has remained quiet since releasing an S-type CME on 2020-08-31T02:24Z directed at STEREO-A, with a possible glancing blow to STEREO-A predicted on 2020-09-04T08:00Z. Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week. Currently, the solar wind speed detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 has values of ~480 km/s due to the coronal hole high speed stream described above; as the influence of the high speed stream subsides conditions will return to nominal values in the next few days.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
