There were 2 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2016-06-22T18:00Z-21:00Z. This slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 around 2016-06-22. \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was elevated starting on 2016-06-25 due to the coronal hole high speed stream described above. However, the energetic electron fluxes remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-06-25T03:12Z     ~550            C               -95/25                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2016-06-28T12:24Z     ~677            C                99/10                17                          STEREO A                          \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-06-29T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-07-05T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.

Geomagnetic Kp index reached level 6 (moderate) during the synoptic period 2016-06-06T03:00Z to 2016-06-06T06:00Z.  This moderate geomagnetic storm was caused by the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 around late 2016-06-04 (see notifications 20160606-AL-001 and 20160606-AL-002).  Simulations carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma crossed the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2016-06-05T13:59Z due to the compression caused by the high speed stream (see notifications 20160605-AL-001 and 20160605-AL-002).  The highest value of solar wind speed reached ~693 km/s around 2016-06-06. \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-06-08T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-06-14T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  There are a few active regions located on the far side of the Sun that can produce solar flares or coronal mass ejections.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to become elevated around 2016-06-11 due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream.    \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
