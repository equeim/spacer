This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate to high levels during this reporting period with 9 M-class flares and 5 C-type CMEs (see details below). \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the combined leading edge of the CME first seen at 2022-03-28T12:09Z (associated with the M4.0 class flare peaking at 2022-03-28T11:29Z) in SOHO LASCO C2 and the CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-03-28T20:23Z (associated with the M1.0 class flare peaking at 2022-03-28T19:23Z) may affect STEREO A at 2022-03-31T07:24Z, STEREO B at 2022-03-31T01:55Z, and NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-03-31T04:12Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 5-7 (minor to strong) (see notifications 20220328-AL-007, 20220329-AL-002). \n\nAdditionally, an ensemble simulation of the two above mentioned CMEs with 36 ensemble members estimated that the combined leading edge of the CMEs may impact STEREO A between about 2022-03-31T01:38Z and 2022-03-31T11:47Z (average arrival 2022-03-31T06:54Z) for 100% of simulations, STEREO B between about 2022-03-30T21:56Z and 2022-03-31T08:45Z (average arrival 2022-03-31T03:09Z) for 100% of simulations, and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-03-30T23:29Z and 2022-03-31T12:03Z (average arrival 2022-03-31T06:10Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 87% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 5-7 range (minor to strong) (see notifications 20220329-AL-001, 20220330-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest values of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods from 2022-03-27T15:00Z to 2022-03-28T06:00Z. These slightly elevated values of Kp may have been caused by the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-03-27 with an associated interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-03-27T00:22Z (see notification 20220327-AL-001).\n\nSTEREO A IMPACT instrument detected an interplanetary shock at 2022-03-24T00:23Z that may be associated with a coronal hole high speed stream. Additionally, STEREO A IMPACT instrument detected an interplanetary shock at 2022-03-27T18:45Z possibly due to the arrival of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-03-25T06:12Z (see notifications 20220325-AL-001 and 20220326-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nA solar energetic particle event was detected by STEREO A, GOES, and SOHO.  At STEREO A, the flux of 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2022-03-28T12:25Z (see notifications 20220328-AL-001 and 20220328-AL-002).  At GOES, the flux of > 100 MeV protons exceeded 1 pfu starting at 2022-03-28T12:45Z and the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2022-03-28T13:25Z.  At SOHO, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2022-03-28T13:44Z (see notifications 20220328-AL-003, 20220328-AL-004, 20220328-AL-005, and 20220328-AL-006).  This solar energetic particle event was due to the M4.0 class flare from Active Region 12975 that peaked at 2022-03-28T11:29Z and the associated C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-03-28T12:09Z.\n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the solar energetic particle event described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-03-25  05:02:00  05:50:00  05:26:00   M1.4   S19E36 ( 12974 ) \n2022-03-28  10:58:00  11:45:00  11:29:00   M4.0   N12W01 ( 12975 ) \n2022-03-28  17:32:00  17:47:00  17:41:00   M1.0   N12W05 ( 12975 ) \n2022-03-28  19:08:00  19:40:00  19:23:00   M1.0   N12W06 ( 12975 ) \n2022-03-28  20:49:00  21:09:00  20:59:00   M1.1   N12W07 ( 12975 ) \n2022-03-29  00:57:00  01:26:00  01:11:00   M2.2   N13W12 ( 12975 ) \n2022-03-29  01:48:00  02:03:00  01:58:00   M1.1   N13W13 ( 12975 ) \n2022-03-29  09:17:00  09:55:00  09:38:00   M1.0   N13W17 ( 12975 ) \n2022-03-29  21:43:00  21:57:00  21:52:00   M1.6   N15W24 ( 12975 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-03-25T06:12Z     ~659            C               -27/-8                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-03-28T12:09Z     ~662            C                12/7                 45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-03-28T20:23Z     ~760            C                 3/3                 50                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-03-23T08:48Z     ~798            C              NONE/-31(POS)          10                          SOHO\n2022-03-23T18:00Z     ~519            C               -90/-21               10                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-03-30T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-04-05T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and strong levels throughout the outlook period. Currently there are seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk.  Active Region 12975 (N13W33) has shown the most activity over the reporting period, producing 8 of the 9 M-class flares during the past week and even produced an X1.3 class flare on 2022-03-30 (peaking at 2022-03-30T17:21Z), which is still being analyzed for a potential associated CME.  This Active Region will likely continue to produce flaring activity and may produce some CMEs as it continues to rotate towards the western limb of the Earth-facing disk.  Active Regions 12976 (N14W11) and 12978 (S20E48) are the other two largest regions on the Earth-facing disk currently and may produce flares as well as CMEs throughout the outlook period. Active Region 12974 (S19W35) has started to decay, but had been the source of the other M-class flare. It may show some lower level flaring activity throughout the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low to strong levels during the outlook period due to the anticipated combined arrival on 2022-03-31 of the CME seen on 2022-03-28T12:09Z in SOHO LASCO C2 and the CME seen in STEREO A COR2 on 2022-03-28T20:23Z as described above.  Additional enhancements to geomagnetic activity may be expected from two coronal holes near the central meridian of the Earth-facing disk as they rotate to a geoeffective longitude by 2022-04-03. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220330-AL-006","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/19601/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-03-30T21:48Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (STEREO B, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-03-30T21:48:55Z\n## Message ID: 20220330-AL-006\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The possible arrival of this CME at L1 might have been detected by DSCOVR and ACE around 2022-03-19T20:57Z, and the possible arrival of this CME at STEREO A might have been detected by the IMPACT instrument around 2022-03-20T20:39Z.\n  \nIt was estimated that the combined leading edge of the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-03-21T06:00Z and the S-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-03-21T08:12Z may reach Parker Solar Probe at 2022-03-22T20:03Z and Juno at 2022-04-07T12:00Z, and might give glancing blows at OSIRIS-REx at 2022-03-24T23:36Z and Mars at 2022-03-25T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20220321-AL-001, 20220321-AL-002, 20220321-AL-003). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 3 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were slightly elevated at the beginning of the reporting period around 2022-03-21T06:15Z and 2022-03-21T08:00Z, respectively.  These slight elevated fluxes were caused by the associated shock of the CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-03-21T06:00Z.  They remained below their respective thresholds for the entire reporting period.  \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to minor this week due to the elevated proton fluxes described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-03-16T13:36Z     ~511            C               -25/1                 50                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-03-21T06:00Z     ~792            C               148/-32               60                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-03-23T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-03-29T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels throughout the outlook period. Currently, there are six numbered active regions on the Earth-facing disk. All of these active regions are expected to remain quiet during the outlook period.  One unnumbered active region near N15E80 rotated onto the Earth-facing disk late on 2022-03-22.  Additionally, one unnumbered active region on the East limb in STEREO A imagery (near latitude S20) may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk early in the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A small equatorial coronal hole that passed the Earth-facing central meridian on 2022-03-20 may become geoeffective on or around 2022-03-23.  Additionally, a larger equatorial coronal hole network is nearing the Earth-facing central meridian at the end of the reporting period and may become geoeffective on or around 2022-03-28.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220321-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/19513/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-03-21T19:36Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs update (OSIRIS-REx, Parker Solar Probe, Mars)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-03-21T19:36:46Z\n## Message ID: 20220321-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A and STEREO B. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2022-03-19T03:04Z and 2022-03-20T02:43Z (average arrival 2022-03-19T12:40Z) for 97% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2022-03-20T03:13Z and 2022-03-20T10:10Z (average arrival 2022-03-20T06:41Z) for 4% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally, the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-03-19T09:28Z and 2022-03-20T18:25Z (average arrival 2022-03-19T22:20Z) for 100% of simulations.

Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model run with 24 ensemble members predicted that the combined leading edge of the CMEs may impact STEREO A between 2022-03-13T00:34Z and 2022-03-13T09:28Z (average arrival 2022-03-13T04:44Z) for 37% of simulations, while the flank of the CME might reach NASA missions near Earth between 2022-03-13T11:12Z and 2022-03-13T12:15Z (average arrival 2022-03-13T11:43Z) for 8% of simulations (see notifications 20220310-AL-002 and 20220311-AL-001). The possible combined arrival of these CMEs at STEREO A might have been detected by the IMPACT instrument around 2022-03-12T22:23Z, later followed by a more prominent arrival at STEREO A of the C-type CME described below.\n\nIt was estimated that the C-type CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-03-10T19:23Z may affect Solar Orbiter at 2022-03-11T21:33Z, STEREO A at 2022-03-13T13:44Z, STEREO B at 2022-03-13T21:55Z, and NASA missions near Earth at 2022-03-13T11:35Z (plus minus 7 hours). Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model run with 48 ensemble members predicted that this CME may impact STEREO A between about 2022-03-12T22:18Z and 2022-03-13T16:21Z (average arrival 2022-03-13T06:48Z) for 97% of simulations, STEREO B between about 2022-03-13T09:08Z and 2022-03-14T05:14Z (average arrival 2022-03-13T17:51Z) for 97% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-03-13T01:38Z and 2022-03-13T18:24Z (average arrival 2022-03-13T09:11Z) for 97% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicated a 73% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 5-7 range (minor to strong) (see notifications 20220311-AL-002 and 20220311-AL-003). The arrival of this CME was associated with the significant interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2022-03-13T10:11Z (see notification 20220313-AL-001) and was also detected by the IMPACT instrument at STEREO A around 2022-03-13T06:35Z.\n\nIn addition, it was estimated that the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-03-11T23:12Z may give a glancing blow to Mars at 2022-03-16T22:00Z, to OSIRIS-REx at 2022-03-16T18:00Z and to STEREO B at 2022-03-16T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). \n\nAlso, it was estimated that the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-03-14T17:36Z may impact Mars at 2022-03-19T00:17Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-03-18T09:29Z, and Parker Solar Probe at 2022-03-16T03:48Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220315-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 6 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-03-13T12:00Z-15:00Z and 2022-03-13T18:00Z to 2022-03-14T03:00Z. This elevated value of Kp was caused by the arrival of the anticipated CME at L1, associated with the aforementioned interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-03-13T10:11Z (see notification 20220313-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained above the threshold level of 1000 pfu through the end of 2022-03-10. This was a continuation of a radiation belt enhancement that began on 2022-03-06 during the previous reporting period, caused by the combined influence of two coronal hole high speed streams detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-03-03 and 2022-03-05. The electron flux dropped to nominal levels due to the arrival of an anticipated CME from the previous reporting period associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR at L1 at 2022-03-10T18:37Z. The energetic electron flux stayed at background levels throughout the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were below the threshold levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to minor this week due to the radiation belt enhancement at the start of the reporting period described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-03-11  22:13:00  22:38:00  22:32:00   M2.2   S28W66 ( 12964 ) \n2022-03-14  08:35:00  08:45:00  08:40:00   M2.0   N23E03 ( 12965 ) \n2022-03-15  12:33:00  12:44:00  12:39:00   M1.4   N24W09 ( 12965 ) \n2022-03-15  22:39:00  22:52:00  22:45:00   M1.5   N24W15 ( 12965 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-03-10T02:00Z     ~551            C               -53/-21               34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-03-10T19:23Z     ~677            C                10/16                61                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-03-10T15:12Z     ~775            C               -93/12                12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-03-11T00:00Z     ~539            C               -90/15                15                          SOHO                              \n2022-03-11T23:12Z     ~544            C                65/-23               33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-03-14T17:36Z     ~748            C               102/-19               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-03-14T21:48Z     ~554            C              -160/-36               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-03-16T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-03-22T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between moderate and minor levels throughout the outlook period. Currently, there are only two numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk: Active Region 12967 (N18E11), which has been quiet, and Active Region 12965 (N24W825) which has shown a high tendency for flaring and recently produced two lower M-class flares. Active Region 12965 is expected to rotate off the Earth-facing disk by 2022-03-21.  One or more yet unnumbered Active Regions now on the East limb in STEREO A imagery (above N20) may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk early in the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A large northern extension of the south polar coronal hole that is currently close to the Earth-facing central meridian may become geoeffective on or around 2022-03-20. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220315-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/19453/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-03-15T13:54Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Mars, OSIRIS-REx, Parker Solar Probe)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-03-15T13:54:48Z\n## Message ID: 20220315-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Additionally, heliospheric ensemble modeling with 48 ensemble members predicted that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO B between about 2022-03-10T01:39Z and 2022-03-10T11:40Z (average arrival 2022-03-10T07:29Z) for 95% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-03-10T08:38Z and 2022-03-10T13:45Z (average arrival 2022-03-10T11:26Z) for 6% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 99% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 2-4 range (below minor to below minor) (see notifications 20220307-AL-001 and 20220308-AL-002).\n\nIt was also estimated that the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-03-08T04:24Z may affect Solar Orbiter at 2022-03-09T17:35Z, STEREO B at 2022-03-11T02:28Z, and may have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth at 2022-03-11T20:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20220308-AL-003 and 20220309-AL-001). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The highest values of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods from 2022-03-05T12:00Z-15:00Z and 2022-03-05T18:00Z to 2022-03-06T03:00Z.  These elevated values of Kp were caused by the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-03-05 with an associated interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR at 2022-03-05T05:44Z (see notification 20220305-AL-001).  The solar wind speed reached values of 560km/s on 2022-03-05.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu beginning at 2022-03-06T12:50Z (see notifications 20220306-AL-001, 20220306-AL-002, and 20220308-AL-001).  The elevated energetic electron flux levels may be caused by the combined influence of a coronal hole high speed stream which arrived on 2022-03-03 and a coronal hole high speed stream which arrived on 2022-03-05.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-03-02  17:31:00  17:47:00  17:39:00   M2.0   N16E27 ( 12958 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-03-08T04:24Z     ~616            C                43/10                34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-03-02T12:12Z     ~577            C              NONE/10(POS)          30                          SOHO, STEREO A \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-03-09T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-03-15T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period.  There are currently nine numbered active regions on the Earth-facing disk.  Active Region 12958 (N17W67) was responsible for an M-class flare early in the reporting period and has since decayed to a plage.  Active Region 12964 (S27W36) has been the source of B-class flaring and may continue to produce flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Active Region 12965 (N22E75), which recently rotated onto the Earth-facing disk, has been the source of B and C-class flaring, and may continue to show similar activity throughout the outlook period.  The remaining active regions have been stable, with some decaying, and may show some lower level flaring throughout the outlook period.  There are at least two unnumbered active regions visible along the Eastern limb of STEREO A EUVI 195 imagery that may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2022-03-14. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period.  The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES has remained significantly elevated due to the previously mentioned arrivals of the coronal hole high speed streams detected at L1 on 2022-03-03 and 2022-03-05.  A small coronal hole structure currently centered around S05E15 may become geoeffective towards the end of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220309-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/19387/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-03-09T11:14Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (ensemble) (STEREO B, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-03-09T11:14:39Z\n## Message ID: 20220309-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO B between about 2022-03-11T00:40Z and 2022-03-11T06:33Z (average arrival 2022-03-11T03:47Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME may possibly reach NASA missions near Earth as a glancing blow at about 2022-03-11T22:00Z (plus minus 7 hours).  Although this possible arrival occurred in 0% of simulations, subsequent analysis of the ensemble output results indicates a potential far-flank influence.

There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 4 for the reporting period. The highest values of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods from 2022-02-27T06:00Z-12:00Z. These slightly elevated values of Kp may have been caused by the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-02-27 with an associated interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR at 2022-02-27T03:30Z (see notification 20220227-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu beginning at 2022-02-26T16:20Z (see notifications 20220226-AL-001 and 20220226-AL-002). The elevated energetic electron flux levels may have been associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-02-19, which reached a maximum speed of approximately 590 km/s during the previous reporting period. The energetic electron flux levels returned to background levels on 2022-02-27.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-02-28T05:36Z     ~516            C               111/-18               17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-03-02T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-03-08T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary from minor to moderate levels during the outlook period. Currently, there are five numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 12954 (N18W44) and 12955 (N16W34) appear stable with no notable flaring. Active Region 12956 (N27W09) has been the source of B-class flares and appears stable. Active Region 12957 (S12E34) has been the source of some low level C-class flaring and may continue to be active throughout the outlook period. Active Region 12958 (N18E37) has been the source of a recent M-class flare on 2022-03-02 and may continue to be active during the outlook period. Two unnumbered Active Regions are expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk early in the outlook period as seen towards the eastern limb in the available EUV imagery from STEREO A.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A coronal hole that started crossing the Earth-facing central meridian on 2022-02-28 may become geoeffective on or around 2022-03-04. As seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO, this coronal hole structure currently spans longitudes from E20 to W30 and may have prolonged effects during the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"}]
