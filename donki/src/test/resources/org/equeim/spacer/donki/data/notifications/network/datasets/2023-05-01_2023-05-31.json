The energetic electron flux levels subsided to background levels early on 2023-05-28.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to minor this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-05-24  09:51:00  10:02:00  09:58:00   M1.0   N18W00 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-24  17:04:00  17:48:00  17:21:00   M1.8   N18W04 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-25  14:37:00  14:53:00  14:46:00   M1.1   S25W06 ( 13312 ) \n2023-05-26  22:48:00  23:13:00  23:03:00   M1.3   S16E06 ( 13315 )  \n2023-05-28  10:21:00  10:55:00  10:36:00   M1.0   S15W14 ( 13315 ) \n2023-05-30  07:54:00  08:19:00  08:10:00   M1.2   S22W90 ( 13310 ) \n2023-05-30  10:15:00  10:29:00  10:22:00   M1.3   S22W90 ( 13310 ) \n2023-05-30  13:36:00  13:41:00  13:38:00   M1.4   S16W42 ( 13315 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-05-29T02:12Z     ~778            C                26/26                23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-05-24T00:24Z     ~907            C               -90/-19               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-24T02:00Z     ~589            C                41/27                13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-24T07:36Z     ~664            C              -105/42                13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-24T10:36Z     ~617            C              -145/-3                32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-25T08:24Z     ~548            C               125/-31               33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-25T21:53Z     ~1314           O              -124/1                 32                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-05-25T22:12Z     ~1349           O              -170/8                 45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-26T03:12Z     ~1655           O                85/-10               29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-26T03:24Z     ~1277           O               124/-6                48                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-27T12:24Z     ~655            C              -110/-14               31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-05-31T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-06-06T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary from moderate to high levels during the outlook period. There are 10 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13315 (currently at S17W58) and 13312 (currently at S25W82 - now decayed to a plage) showed the highest level flaring activity during the reporting period with two lower M-class flares each. Active Region 13315 may produce additional flaring before rotating off of the Earth-facing disk by 2023-06-03. On 2023-05-31, Active Regions 13323 (S03E76) and 13319 (S18W24) produced one lower M-class flare each and may continue to display increased activity through the remainder of the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be minor to moderate during the outlook period due to a possible glancing blow on 2023-06-01 from the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-05-29T02:12Z (see details mentioned above) and the anticipated arrival around 2023-06-03 of the coronal hole high speed stream from the large southern coronal hole currently centered around S35W05. Finally, there might be a minor enhancement in geomagnetic activity in the second half of the outlook period due to a possible glancing blow on 2023-06-04 from an S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-05-30T17:12Z.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230529-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25411/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-05-29T21:19Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-REx)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-05-29T21:19:09Z\n## Message ID: 20230529-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp = 6 occurred during the synoptic period of 2023-05-21T21:00Z to 2023-05-22T00:00Z. This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was possibly associated with the arrival of the S-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-05-19T07:24Z and the Interplanetary Shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2023-05-21T14:20Z (see notification 20230521-AL-005). Previously, additional periods of moderate storms (Kp = 5.67) also occurred during the synoptic periods of 2023-05-20T00:00Z-06:00Z in association with the Interplanetary Shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-05-19T20:36Z and may be associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE and DSCOVR at L1 on 2023-05-20 and possibly one or more minor S-type CMEs which were first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 on 2023-05-16. This arrival was also detected by STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC data around 2023-05-19T16:22Z. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-05-21T14:55Z and remained elevated throughout the reporting period (see notifications 20230521-AL-003, 20230521-AL-004, and 20230523-AL-001). These elevated energetic electron flux levels are likely associated with the combined arrival detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE of a coronal hole high speed stream on 2023-05-20, a possible additional coronal hole high speed stream on 2023-05-22, and possibly the embedded arrivals of two CMEs on 2023-05-19 and 2023-05-21, respectively. The solar wind reached a maximum sustained speed of approximately 620 km/s.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at near-background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the geomagnetic storms and elevated energetic electron flux levels described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-05-18  06:13:00  06:49:00  06:26:00   M1.0   N17E90 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-18  06:48:00  07:02:00  06:55:00   M1.2   N17E90 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-18  11:32:00  12:13:00  11:47:00   M2.2   N17E89 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-18  12:00:00  12:22:00  12:13:00   M1.9   N17E89 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-18  12:39:00  12:56:00  12:49:00   M1.6   N18E88 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-18  17:32:00  18:01:00  17:51:00   M1.1   N17E87 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-18  20:12:00  20:51:00  20:23:00   M3.8   N17E80 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-18  20:51:00  21:16:00  21:05:00   M4.5   N18E80 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-19  00:41:00  00:54:00  00:48:00   M5.3   N18E70 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-19  03:05:00  03:23:00  03:12:00   M1.6   N17E75 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-19  04:49:00  05:10:00  05:00:00   M2.5   N17E75 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-19  19:40:00  20:14:00  20:06:00   M2.3   N18E70 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-19  20:14:00  20:38:00  20:26:00   M2.7   N17E64 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-20  06:49:00  07:12:00  07:02:00   M1.0   N17E62 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-20  07:16:00  07:36:00  07:32:00   M6.4   N17E56 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-20  09:18:00  09:32:00  09:27:00   M1.1   S25E65 ( 13312 ) \n2023-05-20  10:48:00  11:10:00  10:54:00   M1.6   N17E53 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-20  12:25:00  12:40:00  12:35:00   M8.9   N17E53 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-20  14:54:00  15:04:00  15:00:00   M5.6   N17E52 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-20  18:57:00  19:07:00  19:03:00   M1.1   N17E50 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-20  22:52:00  23:21:00  23:06:00   M5.1   N17E48 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-20  23:08:00  23:21:00  23:10:00   M5.1   N17E48 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-21  15:49:00  16:18:00  16:04:00   M2.6   N17E38 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-22  13:30:00  13:47:00  13:37:00   M1.9   S25E36 ( 13312 ) \n2023-05-23  12:07:00  12:17:00  12:13:00   M3.0   N18E13 ( 13311 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-05-17T02:36Z     ~715            C               155/15                35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-17T08:00Z     ~808            C               141/-43               29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-17T10:48Z     ~677            C               143/14                40                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-17T11:01Z     ~659            C               121/-9                30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-18T03:36Z     ~836            C                90/12                29                          SOHO                              \n2023-05-18T21:12Z     ~557            C               -66/40                16                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-20T03:12Z     ~808            C         NONE(POS)/21                12                          SOHO                              \n2023-05-22T00:12Z     ~1452           O              -178/5                 45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-22T08:24Z     ~514            C               107/80                17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-23T00:00Z     ~1056           O         NONE(POS)/-19               10                          SOHO                              \n2023-05-23T08:12Z     ~529            C                65/19                24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-23T11:09Z     ~869            C              -159/-8                45                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-05-24T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-05-30T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary from moderate to high levels during the outlook period. There are currently six numbered Active Regions and two decayed plage regions on the Earth-facing disk. The most complex of these Active Regions, AR 13311 (N18W02), has exhibited extensive flaring activity during the reporting period and may continue to do so during the outlook period. An unnumbered active region seen in STEREO A EUVI imagery near latitude S10 is expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk on 2023-05-25.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at low to minor storm levels during the outlook period. The >2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt most recently crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-05-24T05:50Z and is likely to remain elevated during the beginning part of the outlook period. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230523-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25330/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-05-23T19:53Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (Parker Solar Probe)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-05-23T19:53:01Z\n## Message ID: 20230523-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest values of Kp = 5.33 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2023-05-10T03:00Z-06:00Z and 2023-05-12T12:00Z-15:00Z. The first enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-05-07T23:12Z (see notifications 20230508-AL-005, 20230508-AL-007, and 20230509-AL-002) and the Interplanetary Shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2023-05-09T22:06Z (see notification 20230509-AL-010). This arrival also caused a magnetospheric compression with simulations indicating that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-05-10T03:55Z (see notifications 20230510-AL-001 and 20230510-AL-002). The second enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-05-09T19:00Z (see notifications 20230509-AL-006, 20230509-AL-009, and 20230511-AL-001) and the Interplanetary Shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2023-05-12T05:48Z (see notification 20230512-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was slightly elevated at the beginning of the reporting period but remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period.\n\nAt the beginning of the reporting period, the particle environment was elevated above threshold due to an ongoing solar energetic particle event detected by STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES from the previous reporting period (see notifications 20230509-AL-004, 20230509-AL-007, 20230510-AL-004, 20230509-AL-011, and 20230510-AL-003). The particle environment returned to background levels on 2023-05-12 and remained there until late on 2023-05-16 when a small elevation occurred following a M9.6 class flare from active region 13110 and the unassociated farsided O-type partial-halo CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-05-16T17:48Z. The particle environment is currently elevated, but below threshold at STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the solar energetic particle event mentioned above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-05-10  14:11:00  14:33:00  14:21:00   M2.2   N13W47 ( 13296 ) \n2023-05-11  08:47:00  09:11:00  09:01:00   M2.1   S07W38 ( 13294 ) \n2023-05-11  18:13:00  18:38:00  18:29:00   M1.8   S06W46 ( 13294 ) \n2023-05-16  16:31:00  16:51:00  16:43:00   M9.6   S25E90           \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-05-11T19:00Z     ~546            C                47/-9                28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-11T19:12Z     ~533            C                40/-5                27                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-05-10T09:48Z     ~665            C              -161/-46               17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-10T15:05Z     ~527            C                45/21                35                          SOHO                              \n2023-05-11T05:12Z     ~569            C               168/-15               41                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-11T11:00Z     ~524            C               163/-22               28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-12T02:00Z     ~505            C               -68/-41               17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-13T00:12Z     ~733            C                77/3                 37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-15T23:12Z     ~619            C               -90/-34               25                          SOHO                              \n2023-05-16T08:36Z     ~597            C               136/0                 16                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-16T11:36Z     ~811            C               139/20                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-16T14:00Z     ~511            C               138/18                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-16T17:48Z     ~1480           O               140/13                44                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-16T21:48Z     ~511            C               110/17                30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-16T23:36Z     ~775            C              -121/44                26                          SOHO, STEREO A             \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-05-17T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-05-23T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to reach moderate levels during the outlook period. Newly numbered Active Region 13310 (S25E85) was responsible for the M9.6 flare that peaked at 2023-05-16T16:43Z. This region may produce similar flaring activity as it continues to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is currently expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A solar sector boundary crossing may cause an increase in solar wind parameters between the end of 2023-05-18 and beginning of 2023-05-19. A small diffuse coronal hole currently centered around S15E10 may become geoeffective by 2023-05-22. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230517-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25192/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-05-17T18:00Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Parker Solar Probe)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-05-17T18:00:10Z\n## Message ID: 20230517-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 32 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-05-11T11:21Z and 2023-05-12T09:19Z (average arrival 2023-05-11T17:49Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-05-11T10:41Z and 2023-05-12T00:53Z (average arrival 2023-05-11T15:02Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 73% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-05-10_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178/20230509_190000_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-05-10_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178/20230509_190000_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-05-10_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178/20230509_190000_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-05-10_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178/20230509_190000_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-05-10_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178/20230509_190000_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-05-10_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178/20230509_190000_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2023-05-09T19:00:00-CME-001) is also predicted to have an impact at OSIRIS-REx at 2023-05-12T00:50Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20230509-AL-009).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-05-10_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178/Detailed_results_20230509_190000_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX178.txt\n###\n\n"},{"messageType":"Report","messageID":"20230510-7D-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25074/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-05-10T21:37Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (CCMC DONKI) \n## Message Type: Weekly Space Weather Summary Report for May 03, 2023 - May 09, 2023 \n## \n## Message Issue Date: 2023-05-10T21:37:23Z \n## Report Coverage Begin Date: 2023-05-03T00:00Z \n## Report Coverage End Date: 2023-05-09T23:59Z \n## Message ID: 20230510-7D-001 \n## \n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The arrival of this CME may have been detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-05-07T13:30Z (see notification 20230507-AL-001). This arrival may be a combined arrival with the C-type CME first visible in SOHO imagery at 2023-05-04T09:09Z which was estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-05-07T11:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 2-4 (below minor) (see notification 20230504-AL-001). STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data may have also detected the arrival of these CMEs around 2023-05-07T00:00Z.\n\nAdditionally, the O-type CME first visible in SOHO imagery at 2023-05-07T23:12Z, associated with the M1.6 flare which peaked at 2023-05-07T23:23Z, was estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth at 2023-05-09T17:40Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 6-8 (moderate to severe). An ensemble was also performed for this CME with 24 members. For the ensemble, the CME was estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-05-09T15:08Z and 2023-05-09T20:19Z (average arrival 2023-05-09T17:32Z) for 100% of simulations.

STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data may have also detected the arrival of this CME around 2023-05-09T19:00Z. Analysis of this arrival signature is ongoing. \n\nFinally, the O-type CME first visible in SOHO imagery at 2023-05-09T19:00Z associated with the M4.2 flare peaking at 2023-05-09T18:58Z is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth at 2023-05-11T12:19Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 5-7 (minor to strong) (see notifications 20230509-AL-006 and 20230509-AL-009). Analysis of this event is also ongoing.\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-05-04T09:09Z   STEREO A at 2023-05-07T03:43Z and Mars at 2023-05-09T21:00Z (minor impact) (see notification 20230504-AL-001)\n2023-05-04T10:38Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-05-05T15:38Z (see notification 20230504-AL-002)\n2023-05-05T06:36Z   STEREO A at 2023-05-07T14:14Z and Mars at 2023-05-10T08:51Z (see notifications 20230505-AL-001 and 20230506-AL-004)\n2023-05-05T08:12Z   STEREO A at 2023-05-07T14:14Z and Mars at 2023-05-10T08:51Z (see notifications 20230505-AL-001 and 20230506-AL-004)\n2023-05-06T01:25Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-05-08T07:25Z and Solar Orbiter at 2023-05-07T17:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230506-AL-005)\n2023-05-07T23:12Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-05-10T10:44Z and STEREO A at 2023-05-09T16:55Z (see notifications 20230508-AL-007 and 20230509-AL-002)\n2023-05-09T19:00Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-05-12T00:50Z and STEREO A at 2023-05-11T15:21Z (see notification 20230509-AL-009)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp <=6 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=6 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-05-06T03:00Z-06:00Z (see notifications 20230506-AL-001 and 20230506-AL-003). This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-05-06T00:25Z and may be associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE and DSCOVR at L1 on 2023-05-06 (see notification 20230506-AL-002). The arrival of this high speed stream was also detected by the STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC data around 2023-05-05T12:00Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was enhanced at the beginning of this reporting period due to a threshold crossing during the previous reporting period beginning at 2023-04-30T07:50Z (see notifications 20230502-AL-001 and 20230504-AL-003). These elevated energetic electron flux levels were likely associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-04-26. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux levels returned to background levels on 2023-05-06.\n\nAdditionally, there were several solar energetic particle events during the reporting period detected by STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES. The flux of 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A exceeded the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-05-08T06:19Z (see notifications 20230508-AL-001 and 20230508-AL-003). The flux of one or more of the SOHO >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-05-08T13:13Z (see notification 20230508-AL-006). Finally, the flux of GOES > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2023-05-08T11:45Z (see notifications 20230508-AL-002 and 20230508-AL-004). This solar energetic particle event was likely associated with the M1.6 flare which peaked at 2023-05-07T23:23Z and subsequent O-type CME first visible in SOHO imagery at 2023-05-07T23:12Z mentioned above. \n\nThe environment was further enhanced by the M4.2 flare peaking at 2023-05-09T18:58Z, the associated O-type CME first seen in SOHO at 2023-05-09T19:00Z, and the following M5.0 flare peaking at 2023-05-09T20:52Z mentioned above. This resulted in an additional solar energetic particle event detected by STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES. The flux of 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-05-09T20:39Z, the flux of one or more of the SOHO >15.8 MeV and >28.2 protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-05-09T22:31Z, and the flux of GOES > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2023-05-09T23:15Z (see notifications 20230509-AL-004, 20230509-AL-007, 20230510-AL-004, 20230509-AL-011, and 20230510-AL-003). The particle environment is currently elevated and above the thresholds.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-05-03  09:15:00  09:33:00  09:27:00   M4.2   N13E43 ( 13293 ) \n2023-05-03  10:03:00  10:19:00  10:14:00   M3.1   N12E42 ( 13293 ) \n2023-05-03  10:36:00  10:49:00  10:45:00   M7.2   N12E42 ( 13293 ) \n2023-05-03  12:24:00  12:41:00  12:35:00   M1.7   N12E41 ( 13293 ) \n2023-05-03  13:43:00  13:54:00  13:50:00   M2.2   N12E40 ( 13293 ) \n2023-05-04  08:05:00  09:08:00  08:44:00   M3.9   N16E45 ( 13296 ) \n2023-05-05  07:30:00  08:33:00  08:01:00   M2.1   N15E30 ( 13296 ) \n2023-05-05  15:18:00  15:39:00  15:31:00   M1.2   N16E27 ( 13296 ) \n2023-05-07  21:40:00  22:53:00  22:34:00   M1.5   N17W07 ( 13296 ) \n2023-05-07  22:53:00  00:01:00  23:23:00   M1.6   N17W07 ( 13296 ) \n2023-05-08  20:11:00  20:33:00  20:25:00   M2.3   N14W18 ( 13296 ) \n2023-05-09  03:42:00  04:05:00  03:54:00   M6.5   N14W26 ( 13296 ) \n2023-05-09  05:55:00  06:28:00  06:13:00   M1.2   N14W24 ( 13296 ) \n2023-05-09  10:00:00  10:33:00  10:20:00   M1.3   N14W32 ( 13296 ) \n2023-05-09  18:20:00  19:24:00  18:58:00   M4.2   N17W32 ( 13296 ) \n2023-05-09  20:32:00  21:13:00  20:52:00   M5.0   N13W36 ( 13296 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-05-04T09:09Z     ~831            C               -44/10                45                          STEREO A, SOHO                   \n2023-05-05T08:12Z     ~955            C               -34/2                 37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-07T23:12Z     ~1494           O                14/11                44                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-09T19:00Z     ~1651           O                26/11                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)                  \n2023-05-04T10:38Z     ~858            C               175/15                51                          SOHO, STEREO A   \n2023-05-05T06:36Z     ~790            C               -90/8                 39                          SOHO, STEREO A    \n2023-05-05T16:12Z     ~648            C            NONE(POS)/46             43                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-05-06T01:25Z     ~574            C               102/-28               42                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-05-06T14:48Z     ~1008           O            NONE(POS)/-31            25                          SOHO                \n2023-05-09T08:48Z     ~599            C                20/24                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-09T10:23Z     ~589            C                32/6                 15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-05-10T00:00Z ## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-05-16T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be moderate to high during the reporting period. There are currently nine numbered Active Regions present on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13296 (currently located at N15W47) produced the majority of M-class flaring during the reporting period and may continue to produce notable activity before it rotates off the Earth-facing disk around 2023-05-14.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor to moderate levels during the outlook period. The interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-05-07T13:19Z mentioned above may cause enhancement in the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt during the first half of the outlook period. Further enhancement in the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt may occur due to the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE around 2023-05-09T22:06Z which was associated with the O-type CME first visible in SOHO at 2023-05-07T23:12Z (see notification 20230509-AL-010). Following this interplanetary shock arrival, simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-05-10T03:55Z (see notifications 20230510-AL-001 and 20230510-AL-002). Additionally, the arrival of the O-type CME first seen in SOHO at 2023-05-09T19:00Z may impact missions near Earth around 2023-05-11T12:19Z (see notifications 20230509-AL-006 and 20230509-AL-009). The expected Kp range is 5-7 (minor to strong). \n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"SEP","messageID":"20230510-AL-004","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25070/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-05-10T13:22Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - SEP\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-05-10T13:22:42Z\n## Message ID: 20230510-AL-004\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-05-09T15:35Z and 2023-05-09T21:42Z (average arrival 2023-05-09T18:24Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-05-09T15:08Z and 2023-05-09T20:19Z (average arrival 2023-05-09T17:32Z) for 100% of simulations.

This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-05-08_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX177/Detailed_results_20230507_231200_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX177.txt\n###\n\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"FLR","messageID":"20230509-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25019/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-05-09T03:58Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Auto-generated Space Weather Notification - Flare intensity has crossed the threshold of M5.0\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-05-09T03:58:09Z\n## Message ID: 20230509-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A and Mars. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-05-07T10:18Z and 2023-05-08T02:22Z (average arrival 2023-05-07T16:46Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2023-05-10T13:58Z and 2023-05-11T02:55Z (average arrival 2023-05-10T20:03Z) for 62% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-05-07T16:01Z and 2023-05-08T07:55Z (average arrival 2023-05-07T22:40Z) for 91% of simulations.

This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream observed at DSCOVR and ACE at L1 late on 2023-04-26.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-04-26T12:35Z and remained elevated throughout the reporting period (see notifications 20230426-AL-001, 20230426-AL-002, 20230428-AL-002, 20230430-AL-002, and 20230502-AL-001). The elevation of these energetic electron flux levels was possibly associated by the combined arrival of a CME detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-04-23T17:00Z and then further enhanced by the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream mentioned above starting late on 2023-04-26. The solar wind reached a maximum sustained speed of approximately 675 km/s.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class  Location         \n2023-04-27  11:04:00  11:23:00  11:14:00   M1.8   S22E03 ( 13288 )  \n2023-04-30  19:56:00  20:43:00  20:28:00   M2.4   N14E88 ( 13293 ) \n2023-05-01  00:55:00  01:29:00  01:21:00   M1.1   S24W42 ( 13288 ) \n2023-05-01  13:02:00  13:13:00  13:09:00   M7.1   S24W46 ( 13288 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-04-27T02:48Z     ~774            C               -55/15                42                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-27T04:00Z     ~552            C               -56/-13               25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-29T02:23Z     ~566            C                5/-31                32                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-04-26T04:24Z     ~628            C              NONE/-23               11                          SOHO\n2023-04-26T06:00Z     ~575            C                36/-46               19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-28T02:48Z     ~525            C               -17/-45               17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-28T11:11Z     ~560            C                90/-13               27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-30T02:36Z     ~740            C                38/-26               10                          SOHO                              \n2023-04-30T08:36Z     ~870            C               116/-19               14                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-30T20:24Z     ~974            C               -92/13                37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-30T21:09Z     ~706            C               -95/3                 35                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-05-01T01:48Z     ~592            C              -100/8                 25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-01T03:24Z     ~542            C               -80/15                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-01T06:36Z     ~638            C               -78/26                28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-01T15:23Z     ~565            C               -91/6                 29                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-05-01T23:12Z     ~521            C              -104/3                 18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-02T05:00Z     ~934            C              -178/-29               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-02T16:38Z     ~776            C               104/-47               14                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-05-02T18:48Z     ~505            C               -99/-1                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-05-03T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-05-09T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low to moderate during the reporting period. There are currently eight active regions present on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13288 (S23W68) produced 3 M-class flares and most of the C-class flaring during the reporting period and may continue to produce activity as it rotates off the Earth-facing disk around 2023-05-05. Active Region 13293 (N13E51) has produced 5 M-class flares on 2023-05-03 and may continue to produce similar flaring activity as it continues to traverse the Earth-facing disk.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor levels during the outlook period. The >2.0 energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt mentioned above is currently enhanced and may continue to be enhanced several days into the outlook period. On 2023-05-06, there may be some slight geomagnetic activity enhancement due to the arrival at L1 of a coronal hole currently centered around S35W05 as seen on the SDO imagery.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"FLR","messageID":"20230503-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/24910/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-05-03T11:30Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - M7.2 Flare\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-05-03T11:30:49Z\n## Message ID: 20230503-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
