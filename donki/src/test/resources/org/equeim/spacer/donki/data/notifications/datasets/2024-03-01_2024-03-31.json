The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 57% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate). Full details of the modeled event are available here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/Detailed_results_20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059.txt\n(see notification 20240324-AL-003). The arrival of the combination of these CMEs was detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2024-03-24T14:10Z (more details below). STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data may have also detected the arrival of these CMEs at 2024-03-24T14:27Z.\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact the listed locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2024-03-21T18:48Z    Solar Orbiter at 2024-03-23T02:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20240322-AL-001).\n2024-03-23T01:25Z    Solar Orbiter at 2024-03-23T14:01Z, STEREO A at 2024-03-24T15:36Z, Psyche at 2024-03-27T22:00Z (minor impact), \n                     Lucy at 2024-03-27T16:00Z (glancing blow) (see notifications 20240323-AL-012 and 20240323-AL-013).\n2024-03-23T01:48Z    Solar Orbiter at 2024-03-23T14:01Z, STEREO A at 2024-03-24T15:36Z, Psyche at 2024-03-27T22:00Z (minor impact), \n                     Lucy at 2024-03-27T16:00Z (glancing blow) (see notifications 20240323-AL-012 and 20240323-AL-013).\n\nGeomagnetic activity reached severe levels during the reporting period with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=8.0. The highest value of Kp <= 8.0 occurred during the synoptic period of 2024-03-24T15:00Z to 2024-03-24T18:00Z (see notifications 20240324-AL-007, 20240324-AL-009, and 20240324-AL-010). This significant enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2024-03-24T14:10Z (see notification 20240324-AL-005) which was associated with the arrival of the O-type CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-03-23T01:25Z and 2024-03-23T01:48Z (see notifications 20240323-AL-012, 20240323-AL-013, and 20240324-AL-003). Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2024-03-24T16:25Z (see notifications 20240324-AL-006 and 20240324-AL-008). The arrival of these CMEs were also detected by STEREO A at 2024-03-24T14:27Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nA solar energetic particle event was detected by SOHO, GOES, and STEREO A. At SOHO, the fluxes of the 15.8-39.8 and 28.2-50.1 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-03-23T05:57Z and at 2024-03-23T06:49Z, respectively (see notification 20240323-AL-006). At GOES, the integral flux of the >10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2024-03-23T08:15Z (see notifications 20240323-AL-003 and 20240323-AL-005). At STEREO A, the flux of the 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-03-23T09:55Z (see notifications 20240323-AL-004 and 20240323-AL-006). This solar energetic particle event was caused by the X1.1 class flare from AR 3614 (N25E07) (see notifications 20240323-AL-001 and 20240323-AL-002) and the O-type CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-03-23T01:25Z and 2024-03-23T01:48Z (see notifications 20240323-AL-012, 20240323-AL-013, and 20240324-AL-003), with additional contributions possible from simultaneous flaring observed from AR 3615 (S14E15). The enhanced particle environment at SOHO, GOES and STEREO A began to subside on 2024-03-25, decreasing below each spacecrafts respective threshold and remaining slightly elevated above background levels through the end of the reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this reporting period due to the solar energetic particle event and geomagnetic activity described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-03-20  07:23:00  07:47:00  07:36:00   M7.4   S10E48 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-20  22:46:00  23:00:00  22:55:00   M1.9   S17E43 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-22  20:18:00  20:45:00  20:32:00   M4.2   S14E19 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-23  00:58:00  02:21:00  01:33:00   X1.1   N25E07 ( 13614 ) \n2024-03-23  06:47:00  06:59:00  06:55:00   M1.1   S13E04 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-23  07:01:00  07:26:00  07:09:00   M2.4   S14E11 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-23  07:26:00  07:47:00  07:38:00   M3.1   S14E10 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-23  11:22:00  11:36:00  11:29:00   M1.0   S14E07 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-23  12:36:00  12:56:00  12:47:00   M1.3   S14E07 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-23  13:04:00  13:20:00  13:11:00   M1.1   S14E10 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-23  13:31:00  13:44:00  13:37:00   M1.9   S14E10 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-23  13:51:00  14:15:00  14:02:00   M5.3   S14E05 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-23  14:49:00  14:58:00  14:53:00   M1.5   S14E06 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-23  15:01:00  15:17:00  15:13:00   M3.8   S14E07 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-23  15:17:00  15:27:00  15:22:00   M3.7   S15E05 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-23  16:22:00  17:07:00  16:51:00   M2.8   S15E06 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-23  23:30:00  00:03:00  23:49:00   M2.4   S11W01 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-24  01:12:00  01:30:00  01:25:00   M1.4   S14W00 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-24  01:43:00  01:57:00  01:54:00   M2.1   S14W00 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-24  01:57:00  02:09:00  02:05:00   M2.3   S14E01 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-24  02:09:00  02:29:00  02:18:00   M2.7   S13E02 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-24  05:59:00  06:10:00  06:06:00   M2.2   S15W05 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-24  07:36:00  08:06:00  07:51:00   M1.3   S13W02 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-24  12:10:00  12:22:00  12:18:00   M1.1   S13W07 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-24  12:27:00  12:39:00  12:34:00   M1.0   S15W04 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-24  13:00:00  13:28:00  13:13:00   M1.2   S13W02 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-25  06:37:00  06:48:00  06:44:00   M4.4   S12W25 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-26  00:28:00  00:40:00  00:36:00   M1.8   S12W34 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-26  10:11:00  10:24:00  10:17:00   M1.0   S13W25 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-26  10:36:00  10:52:00  10:43:00   M1.3   S11W34 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-26  12:55:00  13:41:00  13:30:00   M1.9   S14W31 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-26  13:41:00  13:50:00  13:46:00   M1.7   S14W33 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-26  21:43:00  22:07:00  21:58:00   M1.6   S11W41 ( 13615 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-03-21T18:48Z     ~777            C               -24/37                30                          SOHO                              \n2024-03-23T01:25Z     ~1613           O                 2/22                41                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-23T01:48Z     ~1572           O                 5/5                 45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-03-20T01:36Z     ~654            C         NONE(POS)/27                15                          SOHO                              \n2024-03-20T17:36Z     ~893            C         NONE(POS)/-84               45                          SOHO                              \n2024-03-22T14:48Z     ~534            C                12/46                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-23T02:00Z     ~593            C               -95/24                30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-24T15:38Z     ~585            C         NONE(POS)/-63               34                          SOHO                              \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-03-27T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-04-02T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between moderate to high levels during the outlook period with five numbered active regions currently on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13615 (S13W53), which produced all 32 of the M-class flares during the reporting period and 2 additional M-Class flares on 2024-03-27, will likely continue to exhibit notable flaring activity early within the outlook period before it rotates off the Earth-facing disk on or around 2024-03-30.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity might be observed on or around 2024-03-29 due to a possible glancing blow from the S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-03-25T15:12Z. Two small coronal holes, one centered at N05W10 and another at S30E05 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-03-30.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240327-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/29822/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-03-27T15:17Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Mars, OSIRIS-APEX)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-03-27T15:17:18Z\n## Message ID: 20240327-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO A between about 2024-03-24T13:59Z and 2024-03-25T04:12Z (average arrival 2024-03-24T19:28Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-03-24T16:47Z and 2024-03-25T07:59Z (average arrival 2024-03-24T22:32Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 57% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThese CME events (2024-03-23T01:25:00-CME-001 and 2024-03-23T01:48:00-CME-001) are also predicted to have an impact Solar Orbiter at 2024-03-23T14:01Z, Psyche at 2024-03-27T22:00Z (minor impact) and Lucy at 2024-03-27T16:00Z (minor impact) (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notifications 20240323-AL-012 and 20240323-AL-013)\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/Detailed_results_20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059.txt\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"SEP","messageID":"20240324-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/29754/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-03-24T03:01Z","messageBody":"** Note that while this SEP event was unfolding, there were two large data gaps in STEREO A Beacon data (one from 2024-03-23T14:57Z to 2024-03-24T02:55Z and another from 2024-03-23T15:47Z to 2024-03-24T02:54Z).

The enhanced particle environment at SOHO, GOES and STEREO A began to subside on 2024-03-17, decreasing below each spacecrafts respective threshold and remaining only slightly elevated above background levels through the end of the reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this reporting period due to the solar energetic particle event described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-03-14  05:52:00  06:11:00  06:04:00   M1.0   S13W85 ( 13599 ) \n2024-03-16  16:22:00  16:44:00  16:35:00   M3.5   S17E90 ( 13615 )          \n2024-03-16  21:27:00  22:11:00  21:55:00   M1.1   S16E90 ( 13615 )          \n2024-03-18  03:21:00  03:45:00  03:32:00   M2.7   N21W85 ( 13612 ) \n2024-03-18  04:06:00  04:24:00  04:14:00   M1.0   N16E68 ( 13614 ) \n2024-03-18  19:02:00  19:28:00  19:19:00   M6.7   S11E69 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-19  02:24:00  02:38:00  02:29:00   M1.4   S14E65 ( 13615 ) \n2024-03-19  23:17:00  23:32:00  23:27:00   M2.1   S17E56 ( 13615 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-03-14T09:23Z     ~848            C                 8/35                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-03-13T09:04Z     ~667            C              -165/58                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-14T05:08Z     ~827            C              -116/3                 23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-15T02:10Z     ~1121           O               120/-11               51                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-15T04:10Z     ~521            C               -90/-79               24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-15T05:29Z     ~1208           O                96/-21               32                          SOHO                              \n2024-03-15T06:13Z     ~507            C                93/-86               42                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-03-20T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-03-26T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low to moderate levels during the outlook period with seven numbered active regions currently on the Earth-facing disk. Of these, Active Region 13615 (S12E48) has displayed the most favorable flaring potential, producing five of the M-class flares during the reporting period. It will likely continue to produce similar flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Two new active regions are expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2024-03-20 near latitudes N20 and S15 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA). Occasional C-class flaring activity may be possible from these new regions as well as the remaining regions on the Earth-facing disk. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A coronal hole currently centered around S15E15 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) will begin to cross the central meridian of the Earth-facing disk on 2024-03-21 and may reach geoeffective longitudes towards the end of the outlook period on or around 2024-03-24.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"FLR","messageID":"20240320-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/29666/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-03-20T11:56Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - M7.4 Flare\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-03-20T11:56:34Z\n## Message ID: 20240320-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp <= 4.00 occurred during the synoptic period of 2024-03-09T00:00Z-03:00Z. This slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity was likely associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE and DSCOVR at L1 on 2024-03-08.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt briefly crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2024-03-11T13:25Z (see notifications 20240311-AL-001 and 20240311-AL-002) but subsided to near background levels by 2024-03-12. This brief elevation of energetic electron flux levels was associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream mentioned above starting on 2024-03-08. The solar wind reached a maximum sustained speed of approximately 540 km/s.\n\nThe energetic flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at near background levels for the entire reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\n\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-03-08  21:18:00  21:31:00  21:26:00   M1.3   S13W14 ( 13599 ) \n2024-03-10  12:00:00  12:20:00  12:13:00   M7.4   S13W35 ( 13599 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nNONE\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-03-07T22:36Z     ~557            C                95/40                40                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-08T00:00Z     ~517            C                95/18                28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-08T04:17Z     ~639            C               110/37                45                          SOHO, STEREO A      \n2024-03-08T11:48Z     ~687            C               -55/66                24                          SOHO, STEREO A                         \n2024-03-09T04:00Z     ~504            C               -96/-46               35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-09T22:36Z     ~841            C              -126/23                52                          SOHO       \n2024-03-10T11:38Z     ~538            C                90/56                28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-10T18:12Z     ~536            C         NONE(POS)/-13               33                          SOHO     \n2024-03-10T23:24Z     ~558            C         NONE(POS)/43                17                          SOHO                                         \n2024-03-11T01:25Z     ~507            C               161/-9                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-11T13:25Z     ~640            C                90/-55               28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-03-12T10:55Z     ~661            C               -90/-17               19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-03-13T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-03-19T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary from low to moderate levels in the outlook period. Currently, there are seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13599 (S12W76), which produced two M-class flares of the reporting period, may continue to exhibit flaring activity early in the outlook period before it rotates off the Earth-facing disk on or around 2024-03-14.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at low to minor levels during the outlook period. A slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity may be observed on or around 2024-03-14 due to a possible glancing blow from the S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-03-10T12:48Z which was associated with an M7.4 class flare from AR 13599 that peaked at 2024-03-10T12:13Z. A small northern coronal hole centered around N15W45 and a large coronal hole centered around S20W35, as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA, may become geoeffective on or around 2024-03-14 and 2024-03-15, respectively. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240311-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/29557/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-03-11T19:24Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Mars, OSIRIS-APEX, Parker Solar Probe)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-03-11T19:24:23Z\n## Message ID: 20240311-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There are currently eight numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13599 (S13E15) has produced a few C-class flares since rotating onto the Earth-facing disk around 2024-03-01 and may continue to exhibit flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at low levels during the outlook period. An equatorial coronal hole structure currently centered near S10W23 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) could become geoeffective early in the outlook period on or around 2024-03-08. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240305-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/29473/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-03-05T20:11Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-APEX)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-03-05T20:11:34Z\n## Message ID: 20240305-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
