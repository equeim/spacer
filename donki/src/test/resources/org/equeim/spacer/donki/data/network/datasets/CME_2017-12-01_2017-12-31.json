This earlier CME was more northern, and blended with this CME. The source eruption can be seen in SDO - AIA 304 and 171 in the SW region starting around 2017-12-01T0:49Z. The eruption was characterized by a opening in AIA 304 along with an ejection like opening of magnetic field lines in AIA 171.  The earlier source was in AIA 304, on the NW region starting at 2017-11-30T14:07Z, characterized by an ejection to the west.
