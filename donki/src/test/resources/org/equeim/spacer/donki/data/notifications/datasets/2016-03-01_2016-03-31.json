Strong compression of the magnetosphere was also detected at this time. Simulations carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2016-03-11T13:00Z (see notifications  20160311-AL-001 and 20160311-AL-002).  \n\nGeomagnetic activity also reached levels of Kp=5 (minor) during the synoptic periods of 2016-03-14T21:00Z-24:00Z and 2016-03-15T18:00Z-21:00Z due to a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 starting on 2016-03-14T16:20Z. \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period, although they were elevated on 2016-03-09 due to the coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 around 2016-03-06.   \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)                      \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-03-13T20:36Z     ~579            C               -68/-13               21                          SOHO         \n2016-03-10T15:24Z     ~535            C              -107/-13               25                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2016-03-10T19:33Z     ~650            C                90/25                12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2016-03-14T18:12Z     ~544            C               -90/-19               19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2016-03-15T06:48Z     ~590            C                95/50                32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-03-16T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-03-22T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at very low levels during this reporting period.     \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at strong levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=7 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=7 occurred during the synoptic period of 2016-03-06T21:00Z to 2016-03-07T00:00Z.  This strong increase in geomagnetic activity was possibly associated due to the combined effects on 2016-03-06 of the arrival detected by ACE at L1 of a coronal mass ejection associated with a filament eruption near center disk that occurred on 2016-03-03 and a coronal hole high speed stream (see notifications 20160306-AL-002 and 20160307-AL-001).  The solar wind speed reached values of 632 km/s on 2016-03-07.  Also, the combined effects produced a strong compression of the magnetopause boundary.   Simulations carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma crossed geosynchronous orbit starting at 2016-03-06T16:32Z (see notification 20160306-AL-001).  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period, although they were slightly elevated on 2016-03-08 due to the coronal hole high speed stream effects described above.  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed \n \nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-03-09T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-03-15T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  Overall, the active regions on the solar disk show low magnetic complexity.  However, there is an active region just rotating into the Earth's facing solar disk that has been producing some flare activity and has shown some continual growth. The geomagnetic activity is expected to be low as the effects of the high speed stream described above continue to diminish.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

Moderate enhancement of geomagnetic activity is possible around 2016-03-05 due to the onset of a coronal hole high speed stream.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
