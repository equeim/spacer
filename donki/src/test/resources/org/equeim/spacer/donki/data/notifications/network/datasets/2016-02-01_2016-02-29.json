There were 3 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=6 occurred during the synoptic period of 2016-02-17T21:00Z to 2016-02-18T00:00Z.  This elevation in geomagnetic activity was associated with coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 around 2016-02-16 (see notifications 20160218-AL-001 and 20160218-AL-002).  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2016-02-18T16:15Z and the levels remained elevated and crossed the threshold again on 2016-02-19T11:55Z and 2016-02-21T13:50Z. The significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES 13 were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above (see notifications 20160218-AL-003, 20160218-AL-004, 20160221-AL-001).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevation of energetic electron flux on the outer radiation belts described above.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-02-17T06:24Z     ~680            C               151/-30               21                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2016-02-18T23:24Z     ~600            C               -37/-21               25                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2016-02-21T12:09Z     ~653            C               120/-8                31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-02-24T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-03-01T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  There could be some activity originating from the far side of the Sun since there are several active regions that have the potential to produce solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  Moderate enhancement of geomagnetic activity is possible around 2016-02-25 due to the onset of a coronal hole high speed stream from the northern solar hemisphere.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME(s) with ID(s) 2016-02-11T21:28:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20160212-AL-001).\n\n.... Based on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact Mars. For 16 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- Mars between about 2016-02-16T15:11Z and 2016-02-16T19:22Z (average arrival 2016-02-16T17:16Z) for 12% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2016-02-14T06:47Z and 2016-02-15T06:56Z (average arrival 2016-02-14T20:37Z) for 81% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 79% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-02-12_ncmes1_sims16_HILOX055/20160211_212800_ncmes1_sims16_HILOX055_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-02-12_ncmes1_sims16_HILOX055/20160211_212800_ncmes1_sims16_HILOX055_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-02-12_ncmes1_sims16_HILOX055/20160211_212800_ncmes1_sims16_HILOX055_Earth_stack.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-02-12_ncmes1_sims16_HILOX055/20160211_212800_ncmes1_sims16_HILOX055_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-02-12_ncmes1_sims16_HILOX055/20160211_212800_ncmes1_sims16_HILOX055_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-02-12_ncmes1_sims16_HILOX055/20160211_212800_ncmes1_sims16_HILOX055_Mars_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at SWRC is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

There were 4 C-type CMEs (see details below).   Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it was estimated that the CME that started on 2016-01-29T21:17Z may impact Mars around 2016-02-03T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20160130-AL-001).  Based on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it was estimated that the CME that stared on 2016-02-01T20:54Z may impact NASA missions near Earth. Out of 48 ensemble members, 10 (20%) indicate impact at NASA missions near Earth about 2016-02-04T04:52Z and 2016-02-04T11:02Z (average arrival 2016-02-04T07:45Z). The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 97% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 2-5 range (below minor to moderate) (see notifications 20160202-AL-001 and 20160202-AL-002).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.

ENSEMBLE PRODUCT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT MODE. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME(s) with ID(s) 2016-02-01T20:54:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20160202-AL-001).  Based on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth. Out of 48 ensemble members (see notes section), 10 (20%) indicate impact at NASA missions near Earth. Ensemble simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2016-02-04T04:52Z and 2016-02-04T11:02Z (average arrival 2016-02-04T07:45Z). The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 97% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 2-5 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-02-02_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX053/20160201_205400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX053_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-02-02_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX053/20160201_205400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX053_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-02-02_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX053/20160201_205400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX053_Earth_stack.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-02-02_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX053/20160201_205400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX053_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at SWRC is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-02-02_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX053/Detailed_results_20160201_205400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX053.txt\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
