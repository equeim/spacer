There were no major solar flares or CMEs.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The largest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2019-08-05T06:00Z-18:00Z.  This minor geomagnetic storm was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 around 2019-08-05.  The solar wind speed reached values of ~750 km/s on 2019-08-06.  \n\nSTEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a weak coronal hole high speed stream around 2019-08-04.  Solar wind speed reached values of 450 km/s.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2019-08-06T13:10Z and are still currently elevated above the threshold.  These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES are associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above (see notifications 20190806-AL-001 and 20190806-AL-002).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2019-08-07T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2019-08-13T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2019-08-11.  Currently, the energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt are still above the threshold of 10^5 pfu.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
