There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may have a glancing impact at Spitzer, STEREO A, and Parker Solar Probe.  The flank of the CME is simulated to reach Spitzer at 2018-12-27T06:33Z, STEREO A at 2018-12-27T02:46Z, and Parker Solar Probe at 2018-12-26T20:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=3 for the reporting period.\n\nThe STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2018-12-23.  Solar wind speed reached values of ~600km/s on 2018-12-24.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)                     \n2018-12-24T07:12Z     ~588            C              -115/-5                24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2018-12-26T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2019-01-01T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.  There are some small active regions on the solar surface that could have some flare or CME activity.
