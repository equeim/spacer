PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME(s) with ID(s) 2019-03-20T08:24:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20190320-AL-001). Based on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth. Out of 41 ensemble members (see notes section), 40 (97%) indicate impact at NASA missions near Earth. Ensemble simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2019-03-23T02:46Z and 2019-03-24T02:40Z (average arrival 2019-03-23T15:22Z). The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 72% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 2-3 range (below minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2019-03-21_ncmes1_sims41_HILOX070/20190320_082400_ncmes1_sims41_HILOX070_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2019-03-21_ncmes1_sims41_HILOX070/20190320_082400_ncmes1_sims41_HILOX070_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2019-03-21_ncmes1_sims41_HILOX070/20190320_082400_ncmes1_sims41_HILOX070_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2019-03-21_ncmes1_sims41_HILOX070/20190320_082400_ncmes1_sims41_HILOX070_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at SWRC is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2019-03-17T00:00Z-03:00Z. This elevation of geomagnetic activity was associated with a combination of the arrival of a weak coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2019-03-15 and the arrival of a S-type CME around 2019-03-17.

There are currently several small active regions present on the visible solar disk that may have some potential for flares or CMEs.  Recently numbered active region 12736 had some flare activity, the highest being a C4.8 class flare that peaked at 2019-03-20T11:18Z.  A C-type CME was associated with this activity. Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that this CME may affect OSIRIS-REx (glancing blow) around 2019-03-24T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). The simulation also indicates that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth around 2019-03-23T11:11Z (plus minus 7 hours).

There were no significant flares or CMEs.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.

This elevation of geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2019-02-27.  Solar wind speed reached values of ~600 km/s on 2019-03-01.  \n\nThe >0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2019-03-01T15:45Z. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES are associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above (see notifications 20190301-AL-001, 20190301-AL-002, 20190303-AL-001 and 20190305-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed   \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2019-03-06T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2019-03-12T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.
