This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at very low levels during this reporting period.     \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period.  The Kp index reached value of Kp=6 during the synoptic period 2016-09-27T15:00Z to 2016-09-27T18:00Z.  This moderate geomagnetic storm was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2016-09-26 (see notifications 20160927-AL-003 and 20160927-AL-004).  The solar wind speed reached high values of 740 km/s on 2016-09-28.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu.   GOES 13 \"greater than 0.8 MeV\" integral electron flux is above 10^5 pfu starting at 2016-09-27T16:50Z. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above (see notifications 20160927-AL-001 and 20160927-AL-002).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed   \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-09-28T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-10-04T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming reporting period.  The active regions on the disk appear to have low magnetic complexity.  The geomagnetic activity is expected to be elevated  for the beginning of the upcoming week due to the coronal hole high speed stream described above.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   The arrival from the CME starting on 2016-09-14T23:36Z was detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data on 2016-09-17T14:00Z (see notification 20160915-AL-001).  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2016-09-20T00:00Z-03:00Z.  This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream arrival detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2016-09-19.  The solar wind speed reached very high values of ~750 km/s on 2016-09-20.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES are elevated at the end of this reporting period due to the coronal high speed stream described above, but have remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-09-14T23:36Z     ~722            C              -122/-18               43                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-09-21T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-09-27T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  The solar active regions on the Earth-facing side of the disk appear to have low magnetic complexity.  However, active region 12595, which is very close to the west limb, has began to produce C-class flares during 2016-09-21 and may provide further activity.  The geomagnetic activity has been slightly enhanced due to the coronal hole high speed stream arrival described above, but it is expected to decrease in the next few days.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
