Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A and STEREO B. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2022-01-31T21:42Z and 2022-02-01T22:59Z (average arrival 2022-02-01T09:26Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2022-02-01T00:02Z and 2022-02-02T00:57Z (average arrival 2022-02-01T11:51Z) for 93% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-01-31T20:57Z and 2022-02-02T02:10Z (average arrival 2022-02-01T09:07Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 64% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_STA_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-01-30_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111/20220129_233600_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX111_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThe initial non-ensemble simulation also predicted an arrival at Solar Orbiter (see previous notification 20220130-AL-001).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set.

Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model run with 48 ensemble members predicted that the leading edge of this C-type CME will reach STEREO B between about 2022-01-23T15:54Z and 2022-01-24T03:32Z (average arrival 2022-01-23T21:17Z) for 100% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-01-23T21:10Z and 2022-01-24T06:46Z (average arrival 2022-01-24T02:31Z) for 62% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 100% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 2-4 range (below minor to below minor) (see notifications 20220120-AL-008, 20220120-AL-009, and 20220122-AL-002).\n\nAlso, it was estimated that the C-type CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-01-21T09:53Z may impact Solar Orbiter at 2022-01-23T20:18Z (plus minus 7 hours), STEREO A at 2022-01-23T21:33Z (plus minus 7 hours), and may have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-01-24T10:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model run with 48 ensemble members predicted that the leading edge of this C-type CME will reach STEREO A between about 2022-01-23T05:43Z and 2022-01-23T21:52Z (average arrival 2022-01-23T13:10Z) for 100% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-01-23T17:56Z and 2022-01-24T09:03Z (average arrival 2022-01-24T00:58Z) for 68% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is an 80% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor) (see notifications 20220121-AL-001, 20220121-AL-002, and 20220122-AL-001). \n\nThe possible combined arrival of these C-type CMEs initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-01-20T09:09Z and 2022-01-21T09:53Z may have been associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2022-01-24T17:09Z (see notification 20220124-AL-002). The arrival was also detected by the IMPACT instrument at STEREO A around 2022-01-23T11:20Z.\n\nTowards the end of the reporting period, it was estimated that a C-type CME first observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-01-23T10:53Z may impact Solar Orbiter at 2022-01-26T08:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) and may have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-01-26T18:30Z (plus minus 7 hours). Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model run with 48 ensemble members predicted that the leading edge of this C-type CME will reach STEREO A between about 2022-01-26T14:38Z and 2022-01-26T19:04Z (average arrival 2022-01-26T16:44Z) for 18% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-01-26T12:24Z and 2022-01-26T14:43Z (average arrival 2022-01-26T13:27Z) for 6% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 77% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor to below minor) (see notifications 20220123-AL-001 and 20220123-AL-002).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp = 6 occurred during the synoptic period of 2022-01-19T00:00Z-03:00Z. This elevated value of Kp was likely caused by the combined arrival of CMEs at L1 with an associated interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR at 2022-01-18T23:04Z (see notifications 20220119-AL-001 and 20220119-AL-002).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained above the threshold level of 1000 pfu through the end of 2022-01-24. This was a continuation of a radiation belt enhancement that began on 2022-01-16 during the previous reporting period, initially caused by a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-01-14. Elevated energetic electron flux levels were possibly further enhanced during the reporting period by the combined arrival of CMEs at L1 observed on 2022-01-18 and 2022-01-21 (see notifications 20220116-AL-001, 20220116-AL-002, 20220118-AL-001, 20220120-AL-007, 20220122-AL-003, and 20220124-AL-001). Electron flux levels subsided to background levels by the end of the reporting period on 2022-01-25.\n\nA solar energetic particle event was detected by GOES and SOHO. At GOES, the flux of > 100 MeV protons exceeded 1 pfu starting at 2022-01-20T07:20Z and the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu at 2022-01-20T08:00Z. At SOHO, the flux of one or more of the > 15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting around 2022-01-20T08:07Z (see notifications 20220120-AL-002 and 20220120-AL-006). This solar energetic particle event was due to the M5.5 flare from Active Region 12929 that peaked at 2022-01-20T06:01Z and the associated O-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-20T06:12Z (see notifications 20220120-AL-001, 20220120-AL-004, and 20220120-AL-008). The energetic proton flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A was elevated above background levels on 2022-01-20 and 2022-01-21 but remained below 10^(-1) pfu/MeV during the entire reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement and solar energetic particle event described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-01-20  05:41:00  06:12:00  06:01:00   M5.5   N08W76 ( 12929 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-01-20T09:09Z     ~538            C                37/2                 40                          STEREO A, SOHO                          \n2022-01-21T09:53Z     ~739            C               -58/-14               48                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-01-23T10:53Z     ~667            C               -17/11                10                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-01-20T06:12Z     ~1426           O                97/1                 44                          SOHO, STEREO A \n2022-01-24T07:38Z     ~688            C                38/-5                10                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-01-26T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-02-01T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. Currently, there are several numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 12932 (N32W82) has remained a plage and is expected to rotate off the Earth-facing disk by 2022-01-27. Active Regions 12934 (S25E09) and 12935 (N27W18) exhibit a low probability for flaring and CME activity. Active Region 12936 (N14E48) and 12937 (S19E04) are both classified as beta configurations and exhibit an increased probability for flaring activity. Additionally, there are two regions visible towards the eastern limb of the Earth-facing disk. The region to the northeast has been recently numbered as Active Region 12938 and is the source of several recent C-class flares.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO B between about 2022-01-20T19:59Z and 2022-01-21T07:06Z (average arrival 2022-01-21T01:25Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-01-21T09:02Z and 2022-01-21T17:34Z (average arrival 2022-01-21T14:01Z) for 12% of simulations.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate levels during this reporting period with 2 M-class flares, 2 O-type CMEs, and 7 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the O-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-12T04:36Z may impact Parker Solar Probe at 2022-01-13T09:29Z and Juno at 2022-01-27T18:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20220112-AL-001 and 20220112-AL-002).\n\nIt was also estimated that the leading edge of the O-type CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-01-14T13:38Z may impact STEREO B on 2022-01-16T09:58Z (plus minus 7 hours) and NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-01-16T14:39Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20220114-AL-001 and 20220114-AL-002). Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model run with 48 ensemble members predicted that the leading edge of this O-type CME will reach STEREO B between about 2022-01-16T06:00Z and 2022-01-17T06:16Z (average arrival 2022-01-16T14:51Z) for 100% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-01-16T04:30Z and 2022-01-16T23:08Z (average arrival 2022-01-16T12:03Z) for 62% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is an 87% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor) (see notification 20220115-AL-002). The arrival of this CME at L1 is still under investigation.  \n\nAlso, it was estimated that the C-type CME first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-16T16:24Z may impact Parker Solar Probe at 2022-01-19T06:18Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220117-AL-001).\n\nTowards the end of the reporting period, a C-type CME first observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-01-18T18:23Z was associated with a M1.5 class flare peaking at 2022-01-18T17:44 originated from Active Region 12929. This CME is expected to reach STEREO B at 2022-01-20T20:38Z (plus minus 7 hours) and may have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-01-21T11:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 2-3 (below minor) (see notification 20220118-AL-002).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 6 occurred during the synoptic period of 2022-01-14T21:00Z - 2022-01-15T00:00Z. This elevated value of Kp is caused by the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-01-14 with an associated interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR at 2022-01-14T06:50Z (see notification 20220114-AL-003).  \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu beginning at 2022-01-16T14:00Z and remained elevated throughout the remainder of the reporting period (see notifications 20220116-AL-001, 20220116-AL-002, and 20220118-AL-001). The elevated energetic electron flux levels were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-01-14 described above, which reached a maximum speed of approximately 630 km/s on 2022-01-16. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the geomagnetic storm and radiation belt enhancement in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-01-14  01:47:00  02:14:00  02:03:00   M1.8   N30E95 ( 12932 )          \n2022-01-18  17:01:00  18:17:00  17:44:00   M1.5   N07W53 ( 12929 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-01-14T13:38Z     ~1251           O                46/-20               40                          STEREO A                          \n2022-01-16T20:48Z     ~610            C                30/12                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-01-18T18:23Z     ~962            C                53/4                 47                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-01-12T03:12Z     ~601            C              -114/5                 23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-01-12T04:36Z     ~1908           O              -124/35                38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-01-13T08:23Z     ~913            C              -103/14                23                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-01-13T21:09Z     ~542            C              -104/10                17                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-01-14T03:05Z     ~750            C               -85/31                14                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-01-16T16:24Z     ~593            C              -125/-16               29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-01-19T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-01-25T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. Currently, there are five numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 12929 (N07W58) has been the source of one M-class flare and an associated C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-01-18T18:23Z and a C-class flare associated with a C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-16T20:48Z. It may be expected for this Active Region to continue producing some activity throughout the outlook period. Active Regions 12929, 12930 (N21W59) and 12933 (S22W22) are currently classified as beta configuration. Active Region 12927 (S20W53) is classified as alpha configuration and has remained quiet throughout the reporting period. Active Regions 12928 (S20W84) and 12932 (N32E20) have decayed to plages. Active Region 12928 rotated off the Earth-facing disk on 2022-01-19.  Active Region 12929 may rotate off the Earth-face disk early in the reporting period. There are two regions on the east limb that are rotating onto the Earth-facing disk and have not been numbered yet.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to between minor to moderate during the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES has been elevated due to lingering effects of the previously mentioned arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-01-14. Towards the end of the reporting period, geomagnetic activity was enhanced possibly due to the combined arrival of a S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-15T16:12Z and a C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-16T20:48Z associated with an interplanetary shock arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2022-01-18T23:04Z. The geomagnetic Kp index reached level 6 (moderate) during the synoptic period 2022-01-19T00:00Z to 2022-01-19T03:00Z (see notifications 20220119-AL-001 and 20220119-AL-002). A small coronal hole structure situated around N22E15 may become geoeffective towards the end of the outlook period. In addition, a northward extension of the southern polar coronal hole situated at S35W01 on 2022-01-19 may reach a geoeffective longitudes around 2022-01-23.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"GST","messageID":"20220119-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/18887/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-01-19T11:44Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Geomagnetic Storm\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-01-19T11:44:20Z\n## Message ID: 20220119-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO B between about 2022-01-16T06:00Z and 2022-01-17T06:16Z (average arrival 2022-01-16T14:51Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-01-16T04:30Z and 2022-01-16T23:08Z (average arrival 2022-01-16T12:03Z) for 62% of simulations.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity varied between minor and moderate levels during this reporting period. There were 2 O-type CMEs and 2 C-type CMEs, all of which were non-Earth directed (see details below).\n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the O-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-09T23:12Z, the O-type CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-01-10T20:23Z, and the C-type CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-01-11T12:38Z may impact Parker Solar Probe and Juno. The leading edge of the CMEs will reach Parker Solar Probe at 2022-01-11T05:06Z (plus minus 7 hours) and Juno at 2022-01-24T22:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20220110-AL-001, 20220111-AL-001, and 20220112-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-01-08T18:00Z to 2022-01-09T00:00Z. This elevated value of Kp is caused by the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-01-08 with an associated interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR at 2022-01-08T16:58Z (see notification 20220108-AL-003).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt remained elevated above background levels during the first part of the reporting period and later crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu at 2022-01-08T12:45Z (see notifications 20220108-AL-001 and 20220108-AL-002). The elevated energetic electron flux levels were associated with a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-01-01, which reached a maximum speed of approximately 595 km/s during the previous reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-01-07T18:23Z     ~647            C              -160/32                17                          STEREO A                          \n2022-01-09T23:12Z     ~1559           O              -177/33                53                          SOHO                              \n2022-01-10T20:23Z     ~1419           O              -146/26                39                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-01-11T12:38Z     ~615            C              -149/14                30                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-01-12T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-01-18T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. Currently, there are five numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 12924 (S31W47), 12926 (N20W43), and 12927 (S20E32) have been the source of B-class flares and one C-class flare. These regions may exhibit occasional C-class flaring throughout the outlook period. Active Regions 12925 (S33W15) and 12928 (S20E05) appear stable with no notable flaring. An unnumbered active region visible towards the northeastern limb of the STEREO A-facing disk is expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk around 2022-01-14. This active region is probably associated with the C-type and O-type CMEs previously observed during the most recent reporting period and could continue to have notable activity throughout the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period.

It was also estimated that the combined flank of the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-01T17:48Z, the S-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-01T17:36Z, the S-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-02T18:38Z, and the S-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-01-02T11:12Z may arrive as minor impacts at Mars at 2022-01-08T11:00Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2022-01-08T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-01-01T03:00Z-06:00Z and 2022-01-03T03:00Z-09:00Z. These elevated values of Kp may have been associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-01-01.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-01-01  07:07:00  07:42:00  07:30:00   M1.1   N22W76 (12918) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-12-29T03:12Z     ~546            C               122/-30               27                          SOHO                              \n2022-01-01T17:48Z     ~626            C               107/34                 27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-01-05T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-01-11T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be minor throughout the outlook period. Currently, there are four numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 12924 (S32E48) is currently at Beta magnetic configuration and may possibly exhibit occasional C-class flaring throughout the outlook period.  Active Regions 12919 (S13W70) and 12922 (S17W30) have decayed to plages.  Active Region 12925 (S33E85) rotated onto the Earth-facing disk on 2022-01-05 and may become active during the outlook period.  Two active regions on the eastern limb of STEREO A (near latitudes S20 and N30) may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2022-01-08.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be minor during the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES has been elevated due to lingering effects of the previously-mentioned arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-01-01. A northern extension of the south pole coronal hole crossed the Earth-facing meridian on 2022-01-04 and may become geoeffective near the end of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20220105-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/18740/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-01-05T17:21Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-01-05T17:21:17Z\n## Message ID: 20220105-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
