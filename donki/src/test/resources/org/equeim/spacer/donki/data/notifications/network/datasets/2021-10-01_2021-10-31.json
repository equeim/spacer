Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A and STEREO B. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2021-10-30T17:04Z and 2021-10-31T15:53Z (average arrival 2021-10-31T01:53Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2021-10-30T15:25Z and 2021-10-31T04:14Z (average arrival 2021-10-30T22:03Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-10-30T13:04Z and 2021-10-31T01:16Z (average arrival 2021-10-30T18:55Z) for 100% of simulations.

This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-10-28_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX101/Detailed_results_20211028_155300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX101.txt\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20211029-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/18119/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-10-29T12:07Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, STEREO B, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-10-29T12:07:28Z\n## Message ID: 20211029-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

It was also estimated that the combined leading edge of the two C-type CMEs initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2021-10-26T03:23Z and 2021-10-26T04:38Z may arrive at Parker Solar Probe at 2021-10-27T19:42Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20211027-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 3 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2021-10-26  02:40:00  02:56:00  02:47:00   M1.3   N20E90           \n2021-10-26  15:42:00  16:02:00  15:57:00   M1.0   N20E90           \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-10-22T18:00Z     ~662            C              -121/8                 21                          SOHO, STEREO A   \n2021-10-22T21:36Z     ~535            C              NONE/18(POS)           15                          SOHO\n2021-10-25T08:48Z     ~612            C              -160/-17               39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-10-26T03:23Z     ~605            C               -90/8                 25                          STEREO A\n2021-10-26T04:38Z     ~683            C               -90/2                 33                          STEREO A\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-10-27T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-11-02T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be moderate for the upcoming week.  Currently, there are six active regions on the Earth-facing solar disk. Active Regions 12886, 12888, 12889, and 12890 have a low magnetic complexity classification and may not produce too much activity.  However, Active Region 12887, currently located at S26E15, has been somewhat active during the reporting period resulting in two S-type CMEs, and it may produce more activity for the upcoming period.  Active Region 12891, currently located at N20E78, rotated onto the Earth-facing disk on 2021-10-26 and has been active resulting into the two M-class flares mentioned above.  It may be expected for this active region to produce more activity in the upcoming week.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be below minor levels during the outlook period.  Some enhancement may be expected due to the anticipated arrival of the S-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-10-25T05:36Z, which was simulated to arrive as a glancing blow to Earth around 2021-10-29T02:00Z (plus minus 7 hours).  An ensemble simulation estimated the CME to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-10-28T17:41Z and 2021-10-28T17:41Z (average arrival 2021-10-28T17:41Z) for 2% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 100% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor to below minor).\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20211027-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/18082/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-10-27T16:08Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (Parker Solar Probe)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-10-27T16:08:50Z\n## Message ID: 20211027-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were 4 C-type CMEs (see details below). \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-10-17T09:36Z may affect Solar Orbiter at 2021-10-19T08:12Z, STEREO B at 2021-10-20T14:16Z, NASA missions near Earth at about 2021-10-20T04:17Z, and a glancing blow to Parker Solar Probe at 2021-10-19T16:00Z and to STEREO A at 2021-10-20T05:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20211017-AL-001). Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model run for this CME with 48 ensemble members predicted that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO A between about 2021-10-20T01:35Z and 2021-10-20T01:35Z (average arrival 2021-10-20T01:35Z) for 2% of simulations, STEREO B between about 2021-10-20T15:31Z and 2021-10-21T02:38Z (average arrival 2021-10-20T19:47Z) for 54% of simulations, and NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-10-19T22:29Z and 2021-10-20T10:28Z (average arrival 2021-10-20T04:34Z) for 75% of simulations (see notification 20211018-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2021-10-17T18:00Z-21:00Z, 2021-10-18T00:00Z-03:00Z, 2021-10-19T03:00Z-06:00Z, and 2021-10-19T15:00Z-21:00Z. The slightly elevated values of Kp on 2021-10-17 and 2021-10-18 may have been associated with the arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2021-10-16T00:09Z of the the S-type CME first observed in SOHO imagery around 2021-10-12T03:24Z and a possible small coronal hole high speed stream detected around 2021-10-17. The slightly elevated value of Kp on 2021-10-19 was associated with the arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2021-10-18 (see notification 20211018-AL-002).

The M1.6 class flare peaking at 2021-10-09T06:53Z originated from active region 12882 and was associated with a halo C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2021-10-09T07:09Z. \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the leading edge or flank of the CME would reach Solar Orbiter at 2021-10-10T16:55Z, STEREO B at 2021-10-11T15:03Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2021-10-11T19:00Z, and STEREO A at 2021-10-11T22:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). The simulation also indicated that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth at about 2021-10-11T07:50Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index was 5-7 (minor to strong). Additionally, an ensemble model was carried out for this CME. Its leading edge was estimated to reach STEREO A between about 2021-10-11T09:14Z and 2021-10-11T22:16Z (average arrival 2021-10-11T13:47Z) for 43% of simulations, STEREO B between about 2021-10-11T13:19Z and 2021-10-11T23:30Z (average arrival 2021-10-11T18:07Z) for 100% of simulations, and was estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-10-11T06:13Z and 2021-10-11T15:04Z (average arrival 2021-10-11T10:23Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicated that there was a 74% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 5-7 range (minor to strong) (see notifications 20211009-AL-003 and 20211010-AL-001).\n\nThe arrival of this CME was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-10-12T01:46Z (see notification 20211012-AL-003) and STEREO A around 2021-10-12T12:30Z. \n\nThe second C-type CME was first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2021-10-12T03:24Z. It was estimated that the leading edge or flank of the CME will reach STEREO B at 2021-10-15T05:39Z and Solar Orbiter at 2021-10-14T19:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). The simulation also indicated that the CME might have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth at about 2021-10-15T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 2-3 (below minor) (see notification 20211012-AL-005).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 6 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2021-10-12T03:00Z-06:00Z and 2021-10-12T09:00Z-12:00Z. These elevated values of Kp were caused by the significant interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2021-10-12T01:46Z associated with the arrival of the CME first visible on 2021-10-09T07:09Z (see notifications 20211012-AL-001, 20211012-AL-003, and 20211012-AL-004).\n\nAdditionally, DSCOVR and ACE detected the arrival at L1 on 2021-10-06T10:26Z of the CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 on 2021-10-01T16:12Z.  Another arrival was detected on 2021-10-10T12:01Z due to a coronal hole high speed stream. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe flux of 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2021-10-09T07:51Z (see notifications 20211009-AL-001 and 20211009-AL-002). The energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES were slightly elevated starting at 2021-10-09T15:00Z, but remained below the threshold of 10 pfu for the reporting period. These elevated proton levels were associated with the M1.6 class flare and the associated C-type CME.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the solar energetic particle event described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2021-10-09  06:19:00  06:53:00  06:38:00   M1.6   N20E09 ( 12882 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-10-09T07:09Z     ~983            C                 9/6                 45                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2021-10-12T03:24Z     ~512            C                30/-1                35                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-10-13T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-10-19T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Active region 12882 has been very active throughout the reporting period, producing multiple flares of varying magnitudes with some associated CMEs. This active region along with a newly emerging active region just to the west of AR 12882 is expected to rotate off the Earth-facing disk by 2021-10-17. Active region 12884 decayed into a plague during the reporting period and is expected to rotate off of the Earth-facing disk by 2021-10-16. There are two potential active regions on the eastern limb of the STEREO A facing disk that may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2021-10-16.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period due to the anticipated arrival of the C-type CME first seen by SOHO LASCO C2 on 2021-10-12T03:24Z as well as effects from the following coronal hole structures currently visible in the available EUV imagery from SDO and STEREO A. The first of these structures is a small coronal hole seen centered around S05W25 and may become geoeffective on 2021-10-15. The next structure is slightly larger, centered around N30E35 and may become geoeffective towards the end of the reporting period. The last structure is larger, spanning roughly 40 degrees in width, centered around S30E50 and may reach a geoeffective longitude by the end of the reporting period.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20211012-AL-005","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/17951/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-10-12T21:15Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (STEREO B, Solar Orbiter, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-10-12T21:15:52Z\n## Message ID: 20211012-AL-005\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2021-10-11T09:14Z and 2021-10-11T22:16Z (average arrival 2021-10-11T13:47Z) for 43% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2021-10-11T13:19Z and 2021-10-11T23:30Z (average arrival 2021-10-11T18:07Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-10-11T06:13Z and 2021-10-11T15:04Z (average arrival 2021-10-11T10:23Z) for 100% of simulations.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low levels during this reporting period. There were no significant flares and only one C-type CME was observed (see details below).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2021-09-30T18:00Z-21:00Z, 2021-10-01T06:00Z-15:00Z, and 2021-10-02T09:00Z-12:00Z. These slightly elevated values of Kp were associated with the arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2021-09-30T14:15Z of the C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-09-28T07:00Z (see notification 20210930-AL-001). \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week. \n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-10-02T14:12Z     ~769            C               107/-28               23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-10-06T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-10-12T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Active region 12878 remains a plage and is expected to rotate off the Earth-facing disk by 2021-10-06. Active regions 12880 and 12882 exhibit stable configurations and may continue to produce B and C-class flares during the outlook period. As seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO, one unnumbered active region beginning to cross the central meridian of the Earth-facing disk on 2021-10-05 may grow in complexity. Additionally, two unnumbered active regions visible in the southeast of STEREO A EUVI 195 are expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk during the second half of the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A few coronal hole structures are currently visible in the available EUV imagery from SDO. The diffuse structure which rotated across the central meridian of the Earth-facing disk on 2021-10-03 may become geoeffective around 2021-10-07. An elongated coronal hole structure extending from the north pole could affect STEREO A around 2021-10-07 and then later reach geoeffective longitudes around 2021-10-10. An ongoing arrival signature has been detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2021-10-06T10:26Z and is likely associated with the arrival of an S-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-10-01T16:12Z (see notification 20211006-AL-001). \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20211006-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/17899/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-10-06T19:45Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-10-06T19:45:57Z\n## Message ID: 20211006-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
