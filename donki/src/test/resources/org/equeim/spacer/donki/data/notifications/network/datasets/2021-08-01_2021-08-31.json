For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2021-08-28T16:17Z and 2021-08-29T14:51Z (average arrival 2021-08-29T03:34Z) for 85% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2021-08-29T11:26Z and 2021-08-29T20:35Z (average arrival 2021-08-29T16:29Z) for 14% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-08-28T23:30Z and 2021-08-30T05:58Z (average arrival 2021-08-29T13:20Z) for 95% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 66% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089/20210826_185300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089/20210826_185300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089/20210826_185300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089/20210826_185300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089/20210826_185300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089/20210826_185300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089_STA_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089/20210826_185300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089/20210826_185300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089/Detailed_results_20210826_185300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX089.txt\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20210828-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/17601/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-08-28T02:14Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Auto-generated Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-08-28T02:14:10Z\n## Message ID: 20210828-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

It was also predicted that the C-type CME first visible by SOHO LASCO C2 on 2021-08-20T06:12Z would have a minor impact at Mars at 2021-08-24T19:00Z, a glancing blow to Solar Orbiter at 2021-08-22T08:00Z, and reach OSIRIS-REx at 2021-08-23T15:00Z (plus/minus 7 hours) (see notification 20210820-AL-001). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=3 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-08-19T23:12Z     ~560            C              -133/6                 24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-08-20T06:12Z     ~986            C              -136/-22               29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-08-25T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-08-31T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels for the upcoming week. There are two active regions 12859 and 12860 visible on the Earth-facing disk. Active region 12859 has produced some low level C-class flaring during the second half of the reporting period and could continue to produce B and C-class flares throughout the outlook period. Active region 12860 developed overnight on 2021-08-24 and may produce B and C-class flares throughout the outlook period. There are three unnumbered active regions visible in STEREO A EUVI 195.  The two active regions further east in the STEREO A imagery may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk starting around 2021-08-26.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels for the upcoming week due to the anticipated Earth arrival of the S-type CME first seen by SOHO LASCO C2 on 2021-08-23T06:36Z and the expected arrival of multiple coronal hole high speed streams visible at disk center around 2021-08-21 and 2021-08-23, respectively.  Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the S-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 on 2021-08-23T06:36Z would impact missions near Earth on 2021-08-26T20:25Z with max Kp estimates between 2-4 and additional anticipated impacts to Parker Solar Probe at 2021-08-25T05:05Z, STEREO A at 2021-08-27T00:00Z, and STEREO B at 2021-08-27T02:00Z (plus/minus 7 hours).  There are two separate coronal holes that crossed the central meridian of the Earth-facing disk on 2021-08-23 that may simultaneously become geoeffective on 2021-08-30.  The anticipated high speed stream from the coronal hole visible at disk center on 2021-08-21 may have been detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 late on 2021-08-24.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20210820-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/17545/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-08-20T19:35Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Mars, OSIRIS-REx, Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-08-20T19:35:14Z\n## Message ID: 20210820-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
