This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low to moderate levels during this reporting period.  There were 2 C-type CMEs (see details below). Based on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CME starting on 2016-01-26T18:12Z may impact Mars and NASA missions near Earth. For 48 ensemble members simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach Mars between about 2016-01-30T16:20Z and 2016-01-31T12:07Z (average arrival 2016-01-31T01:17Z) for 97% of simulation, and NASA missions near Earth between about 2016-01-29T01:29Z and 2016-01-29T09:22Z (average arrival 2016-01-29T05:31Z) for 20% of simulations (glancing blow).  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 96% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor) (see notifications 20160127-AL-003 and 20160127-AL-004). It was also estimated that the CME may impact Juno (glancing blow) at 2016-02-14T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20160127-AL-005).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=6 occurred during the synoptic period 2016-01-21T03:00Z to 2016-01-21T06:00Z. This elevation in geomagnetic activity was associated with combined effects of the CME impact that started on 2016-01-15T00:00Z (see notifications 20160115-AL-001, 20160115-AL-002) and the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 early on 2016-01-21 (see notifications 20160121-AL-001 and 20160121-AL-002).  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level during the reporting period.  GOES 13 \"greater than 0.8 MeV\" integral electron flux was above 10^5 pfu starting at 2016-01-24T15:05Z.  This elevation in electron fluxes was associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream described above (see notifications 20160124-AL-001 and 20160124-AL-002).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the enhancement of the electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-01-26T18:12Z     ~820            C                55/-30               35                          SOHO                              \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-01-22T19:12Z     ~541            C                 2/-38               22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-01-27T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-02-02T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  There are a few active region on the solar disk with potential to produce solar flares and coronal mass ejections. We are also expecting some geomagnetic disturbance due to the arrival of the CME expected on 2016-01-29 and also the arrival of the northern hemisphere coronal hole high speed stream.   \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2016-01-13T00:00Z-06:00Z and 2016-01-19T00:00Z-03:00Z.  The slight increase in geomagnetic activity on 2016-01-19 was due to the CME (starting on 2016-01-15T00:00Z) arrival detected by ACE at L1 around 2016-01-18T21:00Z (see notifications 20160115-AL-001 and 20160115-AL-002).  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-01-20T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-01-26T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  There are active regions on the solar disk capable of producing solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  Geomagnetic activity increased on 2016-01-20 and 2016-01-21 due to the lingering effects of the CME that started on 2016-01-15T00:00Z and the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 early on 2016-01-21.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME(s) with ID(s) 2016-01-15T00:00:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20160115-AL-001)..... Based on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact Mars. For 32 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- Mars between about 2016-01-20T07:00Z and 2016-01-20T17:48Z (average arrival 2016-01-20T14:50Z) for 40% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2016-01-18T02:22Z and 2016-01-18T12:20Z (average arrival 2016-01-18T07:54Z) for 71% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 96% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-01-15_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX051/20160115_000005_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX051_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-01-15_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX051/20160115_000005_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX051_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-01-15_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX051/20160115_000005_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX051_Earth_stack.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-01-15_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX051/20160115_000005_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX051_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-01-15_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX051/20160115_000005_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX051_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2016-01-15_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX051/20160115_000005_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX051_Mars_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at SWRC is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

There were 3 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2016-01-06T00:00Z-03:00Z.  This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 on 2016-01-05.  The solar wind speed reached values of 669 km/s.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES was at background levels for the reporting period. The 13-100 MeV proton flux at STEREO A had a small increase due to the arrival of the 2016-01-06T14:24Z CME starting on 2016-01-09 and went back to the background levels around 2016-01-11T00:00Z.  \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-01-06T14:24Z     ~940            C               138/-7                45                          STEREO A                          \n2016-01-08T16:30Z     ~662            C                66/-35               21                          SOHO                              \n2016-01-09T14:00Z     ~606            C                46/-24               14                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-01-13T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-01-19T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.

This event is associated with M2.3 class flare which peaked at 2015-01-02T00:10Z and a following CME that started at  2016-01-01T23:12:00 (see notifications 2016-01-01T23:00:00-FLR-001 and  2016-01-01T23:12:00-CME-001).  Solar energetic particle event was detected also by SOHO.  The flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2016-01-02T02:48Z. This event is also related to the  M2.3 class mentioned above and the CME that started at 2016-01-01T23:12:00. The energetic proton flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A was at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic particle fluxes. \n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2016-01-01  23:00:00  null      00:10:00   M2.3   S21W73 ( 12473 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-01-01T23:12Z     ~1588           O                73/-34               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2016-01-03T07:12Z     ~598            C                53/-25               18                          SOHO                              \n2016-01-05T04:36Z     ~530            C               105/-21               19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-01-06T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-01-12T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week. There are some active regions on the solar disk capable of producing flares and coronal mass ejections. There could be some increase of the geomagnetic activity due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream early on 2016-01-06.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
