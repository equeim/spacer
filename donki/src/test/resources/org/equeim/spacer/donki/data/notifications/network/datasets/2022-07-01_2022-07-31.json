There were 5 O-type and 8 C-type CMEs (see details below).\n \nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the combined leading edge of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-07-21T01:36Z associated with the C5.6 class flare which peaked at 2022-07-21T01:11Z and the O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-07-21T01:48Z may affect Parker Solar Probe at 2022-07-22T07:20Z, STEREO A at 2022-07-22T19:09Z, STEREO B at 2022-07-22T21:45Z, Mars at 2022-07-25T18:00Z (glancing blow), and NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-07-22T16:38Z (plus minus 7 hours) with the roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index was 8-9 (severe to extreme) (see notifications 20220721-AL-001 and 20220721-AL-003). Additionally, an ensemble simulation of these CMEs with 24 ensemble members each was made (see notification 20220722-AL-001 and full details at https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-07-21_ncmes2_sims24_HILOX139/Detailed_results_20220721_022000_ncmes2_sims24_HILOX139.txt). The arrival of the combination of these CMEs was detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-07-23T02:28Z (more details below) and STEREO A at 2022-07-23T01:52Z.\n\nAdditionally, the following non-Earth directed CMEs were predicted to impact:\n\nCME Starting time  |  Predicted Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n2022-07-22T17:24Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2022-07-25T03:03Z and Solar Orbiter at 2022-07-25T02:51Z (see notification 20220722-AL-002)\n2022-07-23T19:00Z   Solar Orbiter at 2022-07-25T11:40Z (see notification 20220725-AL-001)\n2022-07-23T19:09Z   Solar Orbiter at 2022-07-25T11:40Z (see notification 20220725-AL-001)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-07-21T15:00Z-21:00Z and 2022-07-23T03:00Z-06:00Z. The elevated value of Kp on 2022-07-21 was likely associated by the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream on 2022-07-21 (see notification 20220721-AL-002).  The elevated value of Kp on 2022-07-23 was likely associated by the combined arrival of the O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-07-21T01:48Z and the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-07-21T01:36Z mentioned above. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2022-07-20T01:00Z possibly due to the arrival of the C-type CME first seen in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-07-15T15:23Z (see notification 20220720-AL-001).  A separate threshold crossing occurred at 2022-07-25T14:05Z due to the arrival of the aforementioned combined CMEs on 2022-07-23 (see notifications 20220725-AL-002, 20220725-AL-003, and 20220727-AL-001). \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)                               \n2022-07-21T01:36Z     ~950            C               -18/11                25                          SOHO                              \n2022-07-21T01:48Z     ~1355           O                 2/8                 45                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-07-21T01:25Z     ~1479           O               -51/-25               22                          SOHO \n2022-07-22T16:25Z     ~632            C                80/-29               14                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-22T17:24Z     ~1361           O               121/21                31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-23T19:00Z     ~1380           O              -178/-18               47                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-23T19:09Z     ~1582           O               175/4                 45                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-07-23T19:12Z     ~952            C                95/-45               34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-23T19:36Z     ~859            C               147/-31               24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-24T18:00Z     ~765            C              -160/-35               27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-24T19:09Z     ~729            C               -66/-42               33                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-07-25T08:36Z     ~726            C              -125/26                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-25T08:38Z     ~616            C                81/12                19                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-07-27T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-08-02T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period.  There are currently six numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk which have exhibited B-class and C-class flaring activity during the reporting period. An unnumbered Active Region near S17E85 has recently rotated onto the Earth-facing disk as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO and may exhibit some flaring activity during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. As seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO, there are several coronal holes structures currently visible on the Earth-facing disk. One of these structures which recently crossed the Earth-facing central meridian and is currently centered near N15W10, may become geoeffective on or around 2022-07-29. The other structures, visible in the southeastern quadrant of the Earth-facing disk, may begin to reach geoeffective longitudes on or around 2022-08-01.

The previous heliospheric modeling simulated these two CMEs (2022-07-21T01:36:00-CME-001 and 2022-07-21T01:48:00-CME-001) along with one other CME (2022-07-21T01:25:00-CME-001) which is not anticipated to impact any missions.\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

Additionally, an ensemble simulation of this CME with 48 ensemble members was made (see notification 20220716-AL-004 and full details at https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-07-16_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX137/Detailed_results_20220715_172400_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX137.txt).  The arrival of this CME at L1 was likely detected by DSCOVR and ACE around 2022-07-18T20:40Z (see notification 20220718-AL-003).\n\nIt was also estimated that the C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-07-16T17:09Z may affect Parker Solar Probe at 2022-07-19T03:45Z, STEREO B at 2022-07-20T06:42Z, Mars (glancing blow) at 2022-07-21T19:00Z, and NASA missions near Earth at 2022-07-20T06:48Z (plus minus 7 hours) with the roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index 3-5 (below minor to minor) (see notification 20220717-AL-001).  Additionally, an ensemble simulation of this CME with 48 ensemble members was made (see notification 20220718-AL-001 and full details at https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-07-17_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX138/Detailed_results_20220716_170900_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX138.txt).\n\nAdditionally, the following non-Earth directed CMEs were predicted to impact:\nCME Starting time  |  Predicted Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n2022-07-13T13:25Z   Mars at 2022-07-17T07:47Z, OSIRIS-REx (minor impact) at 2022-07-16T05:00Z, Parker Solar Probe (minor impact) at 2022-07-15T16:00Z (see notification 20220713-AL-001)\n2022-07-17T02:38Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2022-07-19T19:34Z, Mars (glancing blow) at 2022-07-21T15:00Z, Juno (glancing blow) at 2022-08-08T07:00Z (see notifications 20220717-AL-002, 20220717-AL-003)\n2022-07-18T16:36Z   Solar Orbiter at 2022-07-21T14:26Z (see notification 20220718-AL-004)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period 2022-07-19T06:00Z-09:00Z. This elevated value of Kp was likely caused by the arrival of the C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-07-15T15:23Z.  This arrival was associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-07-18T20:40Z (notification 20220718-AL-003).  In addition, the interplanetary shock may have been associated with a strong compression of the magnetosphere.  Simulations carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2022-07-19T13:23Z (see notifications 20220719-AL-001, 20220719-AL-002).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2022-07-16T07:20Z and remained elevated until 2022-07-18.  The elevated energetic electron flux levels were likely caused by the high speed stream starting on 2022-07-12, which had a maximum speed of 589 km/s (see notifications 20220716-AL-001, 20220716-AL-002, 20220718-AL-002).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to minor this week due to elevated energetic electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-07-14  04:22:00  04:40:00  04:31:00   M1.2   N15E81 (13058) \n2022-07-14  21:42:00  21:53:00  21:48:00   M2.8   N15E71 (13058) \n2022-07-16  06:16:00  06:34:00  06:29:00   M1.1   N18E19 (13057) \n2022-07-16  15:33:00  15:44:00  15:39:00   M1.4   S18W56 (13055) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-07-15T15:23Z     ~539            C                12/21                41                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-07-16T17:09Z     ~518            C                15/18                31                          STEREO A                          \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-07-13T13:25Z     ~988            C                54/12                17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-14T22:24Z     ~591            C              -103/14                18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-15T18:12Z     ~509            C               -90/4                 10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-15T21:12Z     ~515            C               -71/3                 10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-16T18:09Z     ~577            C                37/-55               32                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-07-17T02:38Z     ~714            C                76/24                25                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-07-18T16:36Z     ~801            C               139/27                27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-07-20T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-07-26T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently nine numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13058 (N13W00) produced 2 M-class flares and several C-class flares during the reporting period.  Active Region 13057 (N15W37) produced one M-class flare during the reporting period.  Active Region 13056 (S16W57) is magnetically complex and has generated some C-class flaring but is expected to rotate off the Earth-facing disk by 2022-07-22. All of these regions may remain active for the next upcoming period. \n \nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels throughout the outlook period. Two large coronal holes crossed the Earth-facing central meridian on 2022-07-18 and may become geoeffective around 2022-07-22.  We may expect some geomagnetic activity by the arrival of the C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-07-16T17:09Z mentioned above.  Additionally, there is a possible arrival of a Solar Sector Boundary Crossing around 2022-07-21 as shown in the ambient ENLIL models.  Finally, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt has become elevated following the arrival of the C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-07-15T15:23Z, mentioned above (see notification 20220720-AL-001).\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20220720-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/20907/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-07-20T12:50Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-07-20T12:50:58Z\n## Message ID: 20220720-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The previous heliospheric modeling simulated this CME (2022-07-16T17:09:00-CME-001) along with two other CMEs (2022-07-16T18:09:00-CME-001 and 2022-07-16T16:53:00-CME-001) which are not anticipated to impact any missions.\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

Additionally, an ensemble simulation of this CME with 48 ensemble members was made (see notification 20220709-AL-004 and full details at https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-07-09_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX136/Detailed_results_20220708_233100_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX136.txt).  The arrival of this CME at L1 was likely detected by DSCOVR and ACE around 2022-07-11T09:22Z (see notification 20220711-AL-001) and at STEREO A around 2022-07-10T16:30Z.\n\nIt was also estimated that the O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-07-09T23:12Z may affect Parker Solar Probe at 2022-07-11T10:18Z, STEREO B at 2022-07-12T10:12Z, and Mars at 2022-07-13T17:00Z. Additionally, this CME might give a glancing blow to NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-07-12T18:00Z (plus minus 7 hours), with the roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index 3-4 (below minor) (see notification 20220711-AL-002).\n\nAdditionally, the following non-Earth directed CMEs were predicted to impact: \nCME Starting time | Predicted Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n2022-07-09T14:00Z | Mars at 2022-07-12T22:24Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-07-11T13:42Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2022-07-11T19:00Z (notification 20220709-AL-003)\n2022-07-11T13:09Z | OSIRIS-REx at 2022-07-14T02:42Z and Solar Orbiter at 2022-07-14T08:25Z (notification 20220711-AL-003)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 5 for the reporting period. Two separate increases of Kp to 5 were observed during the reporting period.  The first increase of Kp to 5, encompassing synoptic periods 2022-07-07T12:00Z-15:00Z and 2022-07-07T21:00Z to 2022-07-08T06:00Z, was possibly caused by the arrival at L1 of the S-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-07-03T03:09Z, which was associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE around 2022-07-07T08:08Z and a modeled compression of the Earth's magnetosphere starting around 2022-07-07T13:15Z (see notifications 20220707-AL-001, 20220707-AL-004, 20220707-AL-002, and 20220707-AL-003). The other increase of Kp to 5 occurred during the 2022-07-12T12:00Z-15:00Z synoptic period and was likely caused by the combined arrival of the C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-07-08T20:48Z detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE around 2022-07-11T09:22Z (see notifications 20220711-AL-001, 20220709-AL-002, 20220709-AL-004) and a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-07-12. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nA solar energetic particle event was detected by SOHO during the reporting period. The flux of both the 15.8-39.8 MeV and the 28.2-50.1 MeV protons channels at SOHO exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2022-07-09T15:23Z (see notification 20220709-AL-001). This solar energetic particle event was associated with the C8.5 flare from Active Region 13047 that peaked at 2022-07-09T13:48Z and the associated C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-07-09T14:00Z. These events also caused minor elevations of the energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A above background levels, but the fluxes at GOES and STEREO A remained below their respective thresholds of 1 pfu and 10^(-1) pfu/MeV.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the solar energetic particle event described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-07-08  20:07:00  21:28:00  20:49:00   M2.5   N20E40 ( 13053 ) \n2022-07-10  23:30:00  23:52:00  23:43:00   M1.3   S19E71 ( 13056 ) \n2022-07-11  09:08:00  09:39:00  09:19:00   M1.1   S15E60 ( 13056 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-07-08T20:48Z     ~735            C               -33/2                 47                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-09T23:12Z     ~1258           O                30/24                24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-07-07T17:36Z     ~593            C                97/-14               11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-08T01:25Z     ~1289           O                80/-52               27                          SOHO                              \n2022-07-09T14:00Z     ~1080           O                88/-7                39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-10T18:12Z     ~1276           O                75/-61               14                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-11T13:09Z     ~846            C               116/7                 35                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-07-13T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-07-19T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently five numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13056 (S16E26) produced 2 M-class flares and many C-class flares during the reporting period.  Active Region 13053 (N15W30) produced one M-class flare and many C-class flares during the reporting period.  Both regions may continue to be active for the upcoming period. An unnumbered Active Region observed on the eastern limb in STEREO A EUVI 195 imagery near latitude N15 may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk around 2022-07-14.\n \nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels throughout the outlook period.

For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2022-07-10T14:08Z and 2022-07-11T08:43Z (average arrival 2022-07-10T23:00Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2022-07-11T12:08Z and 2022-07-11T12:08Z (average arrival 2022-07-11T12:08Z) for 2% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-07-10T19:40Z and 2022-07-11T15:14Z (average arrival 2022-07-11T05:49Z) for 100% of simulations.

This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

There were 1 O-type CMEs and 7 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the following non-Earth directed CMEs were predicted to impact: \n\nCME Starting time  Predicted Mission Impacts\n2022-06-28T19:00Z   Mars at 2022-07-02T14:51Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2022-07-01T14:51Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220629-AL-001)\n2022-06-28T23:12Z   Mars at 2022-07-02T14:51Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2022-07-01T14:51Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220629-AL-001)\n2022-06-29T23:12Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2022-07-02T08:59Z and Mars at 2022-07-03T11:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220630-AL-001)\n2022-06-30T03:24Z   Solar Orbiter at 2022-07-02T16:01Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220630-AL-002)\n2022-07-03T04:12Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2022-07-05T11:59Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220703-AL-002)\n\nAdditionally, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-07-05T04:24Z may impact Parker Solar Probe at 2022-07-07T06:41Z, STEREO B at 2022-07-08T12:43Z, and NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-07-08T14:30Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 3-5 (below minor to minor) (see notification 20220705-AL-001).  An ensemble simulation of this CME with 24 ensemble members estimated that the leading edge of the CME may impact STEREO B between about 2022-07-08T11:15Z and 2022-07-08T19:47Z (average arrival 2022-07-08T14:26Z) for 79% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-07-08T12:28Z and 2022-07-08T18:25Z (average arrival 2022-07-08T14:19Z) for 33% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 75% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor) (see notification 20220706-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 5 for the reporting period. The highest values of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods 2022-07-02T03:00Z-06:00Z and 2022-07-04T03:00Z-06:00Z.  The first synoptic period of Kp=5 was likely caused by the arrival of the CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-06-26T18:23Z, associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-07-01T09:05Z (see notification 20220702-AL-001).  The second synoptic period of Kp=5 was likely caused by the arrival of the CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-06-29T02:09Z, associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-07-03T07:01Z (see notification 20220703-AL-001).\n\nThe >2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected at GOES remained elevated above 1000 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period. These elevated energetic electron flux levels were likely caused by the coronal hole high speed stream which arrived on 2022-06-25, reaching a maximum speed of approximately 750 km/s (see notification 20220630-AL-003).  Energetic electron fluxes returned to background levels late on 2022-07-01 and remained below the threshold for the rest of the reporting period.  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to minor due the elevated energetic electron fluxes mentioned above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-07-05T04:24Z     ~514            C                27/-24               42                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-06-29T11:09Z     ~657            C               133/-36               33                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-06-29T23:12Z     ~1104           O                95/38                33                          SOHO                              \n2022-06-30T03:24Z     ~813            C               162/17                47                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-02T03:12Z     ~797            C               -73/47                18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-03T04:12Z     ~832            C               105/26                28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-03T05:12Z     ~537            C                99/11                18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-05T04:48Z     ~543            C               119/5                 26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-07-06T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-07-12T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently several numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk, including newly-numbered Active Region 13054 (N21W21).  Active Region 13053 (N14E72) has been the most active and magnetically complex of these regions since it was numbered on 2022-07-05, and is likely to remain active during the outlook period.  Additionally, an unnumbered Active Region observed over the eastern limb in STEREO A EUVI 195 imagery (near latitude N25) may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk during the first part of the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between below minor and minor levels during the outlook period.  We may expect some geomagnetic activity by the arrival of the C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-07-05T04:24Z mentioned above at missions near Earth around 2022-07-08.  Additionally, there is a possible arrival of a Solar Sector Boundary Crossing around 2022-07-08 as shown in the ambient ENLIL models.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220706-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/20725/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-07-06T17:30Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (ensemble) (STEREO B, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-07-06T17:30:59Z\n## Message ID: 20220706-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
