Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-06-30T10:58Z and 2023-07-01T06:07Z (average arrival 2023-06-30T20:14Z) for 83% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-06-30T16:49Z and 2023-07-01T12:52Z (average arrival 2023-07-01T02:48Z) for 79% of simulations.

The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-06-25T00:00Z-03:00Z. This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-06-24T18:10Z which may be associated with the arrival of a C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-06-20T17:24Z in the last reporting period (see notification 20230624-AL-001). The arrival of this CME may also have been detected by STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments on 2023-06-24T17:45Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was elevated throughout the reporting period, crossing the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-06-23T14:10Z and again at 2023-06-27T12:50Z (see notifications 20230621-AL-003, 20230623-AL-001, 20230627-AL-001, and 20230627-AL-002). The first enhancement at 2023-06-23T14:10Z is likely associated with the effects from the coronal hole high speed stream which arrived on 2023-06-19 during the last reporting period (see notification 20230623-AL-001). The second enhancement at 2023-06-27T12:50Z is likely associated with the combined effects of the arrival of a CME with ID 2023-06-20T17:24:00-CME-001 (see notification 20230620-AL-003) detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-06-24T18:10Z (see notification 20230624-AL-001) and a new coronal hole high speed stream which arrived on 2023-06-23. The maximum sustained solar wind speed at L1 reached approximately 575 km/s. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the minor geomagnetic storm and elevated energetic electron flux levels described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-06-21  12:31:00  12:54:00  12:44:00   M1.1   S15E51 ( 13341 ) \n2023-06-21  15:31:00  15:43:00  15:38:00   M1.0   N19W05 ( 13337 ) \n2023-06-22  10:57:00  11:36:00  11:21:00   M1.1   S15E42 ( 13341 ) \n2023-06-22  23:29:00  23:57:00  23:44:00   M4.8   S20E40 ( 13341 ) \n2023-06-24  12:11:00  12:24:00  12:17:00   M1.1   N20W42 ( 13337 ) \n2023-06-26  16:08:00  16:34:00  16:22:00   M1.6   N23W40 ( 13340 ) \n2023-06-27  14:57:00  15:19:00  15:14:00   M1.2   N20W53 ( 13340 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-06-23T00:39Z     ~665            C               -41/-43               35                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-06-26T12:12Z     ~690            C               -12/35                26                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-06-27T20:36Z     ~520            C               -26/18                39                          SOHO, STEREO A              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-06-21T01:48Z     ~699            C               -57/-10               26                          SOHO                              \n2023-06-21T09:48Z     ~773            C               -97/35                38                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-06-22T13:09Z     ~501            C            NONE(POS)/-24            49                          STEREO A       \n2023-06-24T08:12Z     ~667            C                43/31                13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-24T12:38Z     ~838            C                45/30                23                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-06-25T02:00Z     ~668            C               -75/-72               25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-25T21:12Z     ~542            C                76/23                31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-26T03:24Z     ~571            C               168/63                18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-26T15:53Z     ~925            C               -75/11                38                          STEREO A                          \n2023-06-27T07:24Z     ~771            C               108/7                 27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-06-28T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date: 2023-07-04T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary from moderate to high levels during the outlook period. There are currently eight numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13340 (currently located at N23W66) and Active Region 13341 (currently located at S15E41) produced the majority of M-class and C-class flaring during the reporting period and may continue to produce notable activity as they traverse the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13354 (N15E04) has exhibited recent growth and was recently responsible for a potentially Earth-directed CME first seen in SOHO coronagraph imagery at 2023-06-27T20:36Z. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at low to minor storm levels during the outlook period. Barring any new Earth-directed CMEs, a CME first seen in the SOHO coronagraphs at 2023-06-27T20:36Z is expected to arrive at L1 around 2023-07-01T04:55Z and may lead to an enhancement in geomagnetic activity, possibly up to minor storm levels (see notification 20230628-AL-001). \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230628-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25759/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-06-28T16:45Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (STEREO A, OSIRIS-REx, Parker Solar Probe, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-06-28T16:45:24Z\n## Message ID: 20230628-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp=6.33 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-06-16T03:00Z-06:00Z (see notifications 20230616-AL-001, 20230616-AL-002, and 20230616-AL-003). This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected by ACE and DSCOVR at L1 on 2023-06-15T05:46Z caused by the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream (see notification 20230615-AL-001). The arrival of this coronal hole high speed stream was also detected by STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments on 2023-06-14.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt remained elevated since 2023-06-17T13:35Z, most recently crossing the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-06-20T12:35Z (see notifications 20230617-AL-001, 20230617-AL-002, and 20230619-AL-001). These elevated energetic electron flux levels are likely associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 mentioned above. The solar wind reached a maximum sustained speed of approximately 700 km/s.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-06-16  05:21:00  05:41:00  05:30:00   M1.0   N17E66 ( 13337 ) \n2023-06-16  10:20:00  10:59:00  10:38:00   M1.0   N11E67 ( 13338 ) \n2023-06-16  19:52:00  20:07:00  19:59:00   M1.0   S25W50 ( 13331 ) \n2023-06-18  00:25:00  00:40:00  00:31:00   M1.3   S22E26 ( 13336 ) \n2023-06-18  13:25:00  14:14:00  13:53:00   M2.5   S23E21 ( 13336 ) \n2023-06-19  03:37:00  03:58:00  03:50:00   M1.4   S12E90 ( 13341 ) \n2023-06-19  12:06:00  12:18:00  12:14:00   M1.1   S12E80 ( 13341 ) \n2023-06-20  11:09:00  11:17:00  11:13:00   M1.0   S22W66 ( 13342 ) \n2023-06-20  11:17:00  11:35:00  11:25:00   M1.8   S22W66 ( 13342 ) \n2023-06-20  15:44:00  15:55:00  15:48:00   M1.0   S22W68 ( 13342 ) \n2023-06-20  16:27:00  16:42:00  16:33:00   M1.1   S22W69 ( 13342 ) \n2023-06-20  16:42:00  17:26:00  17:09:00   X1.1   S15E65 ( 13341 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-06-20T17:24Z     ~872            C               -70/-14               43                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-06-14T01:36Z     ~553            C              -122/23                12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-14T09:48Z     ~576            C               -75/-9                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-14T11:24Z     ~515            C              -116/29                19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-16T11:09Z     ~977            C               -65/-4                30                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-06-17T10:48Z     ~573            C               -95/-42               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-18T00:12Z     ~1106           O                22/-30               12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-18T14:12Z     ~1043           O               -29/-30               14                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-20T11:48Z     ~524            C               133/-9                30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-06-21T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-06-27T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently ten numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13341 (currently located at S15E50) produced an X1.1 flare (see notifications 20230620-AL-001 and 20230620-AL-002) and may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity during the outlook period. Additionally, Active Region 13342 (currently located at S22W81) produced a majority of the M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to produce flaring activity before rotating off the Earth-facing disk by 2023-06-22. Finally, an unnumbered Active Region seen in STEREO A EUVI imagery near latitude N15 may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2023-06-22.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt most recently crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-06-20T12:35Z due to the coronal hole high speed steam starting on 2023-06-15 mentioned above and will likely remain elevated during the beginning of the outlook period (see notification 20230621-AL-003). There may be additional minor enhancement in geomagnetic activity due to the arrival of the C-type CME which may impact NASA missions near Earth around 2023-06-24 (see details above).\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20230621-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25665/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-06-21T19:24Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-06-21T19:24:37Z\n## Message ID: 20230621-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-06-11T23:29Z and 2023-06-11T23:29Z (average arrival 2023-06-11T23:29Z) for 4% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-06-12T00:47Z and 2023-06-12T05:06Z (average arrival 2023-06-12T02:31Z) for 16% of simulations.

The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-06-04T18:00Z-21:00Z. This slight enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-06-03T18:28Z which may be associated with the arrival of a S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-05-30T17:12Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was slightly elevated at the beginning of the reporting period but remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-05-31  04:24:00  04:44:00  04:38:00   M1.3   S09E88 ( 13323 ) \n2023-05-31  12:23:00  12:30:00  12:26:00   M1.0   S18W22 ( 13319 ) \n2023-05-31  21:47:00  22:14:00  22:08:00   M1.0   S07E89 ( 13323 ) \n2023-05-31  22:14:00  23:12:00  22:52:00   M4.2   S07E82 ( 13323 ) \n2023-06-02  02:32:00  02:45:00  02:41:00   M1.5   N18E02 ( 13324 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-06-04T10:24Z     ~692            C                30/-12               33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-06T03:48Z     ~617            C               -63/10                44                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-06-01T00:36Z     ~1662           O                80/54                38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-02T20:00Z     ~1240           O               127/20                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-03T07:48Z     ~612            C               130/25                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-06-04T04:12Z     ~782            C            NONE(POS)/-47            18                          SOHO\n2023-06-04T19:48Z     ~522            C                90/0                 13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-06-07T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-06-13T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently nine numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13323 (currently located at S08W22) and Active Region 13327 (currently located at S14E32) produced the majority of M and C-class flaring during the reporting period and may continue to produce notable activity as they traverse the Earth-facing disk. Additionally, there are at least two unnumbered Active Regions seen near the eastern limb in SDO imagery located around latitudes S22 and N10 which may exhibit flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be minor to moderate during the outlook period. There may be a minor enhancement in geomagnetic activity during the first half of the outlook period due to possible arrivals at L1 on 2023-06-07 and 2023-06-09 from the CMEs mentioned above. Finally, there may be additional enhancement in geomagnetic activity in the second half of the outlook period due to the possible arrival of coronal hole high speed streams from coronal holes currently centered around N20E02 and S37E12. These coronal holes may reach geoeffective longitudes on or around 2023-06-10.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230607-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25491/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-06-07T15:12Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-06-07T15:12:55Z\n## Message ID: 20230607-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME with ID 2023-06-04T10:24:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20230604-AL-001). Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 32 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-06-07T05:56Z and 2023-06-07T14:31Z (average arrival 2023-06-07T10:18Z) for 34% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-06-07T04:32Z and 2023-06-07T16:35Z (average arrival 2023-06-07T10:30Z) for 62% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 95% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-06-04_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179/20230604_102400_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-06-04_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179/20230604_102400_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-06-04_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179/20230604_102400_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-06-04_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179/20230604_102400_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-06-04_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179/20230604_102400_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-06-04_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179/20230604_102400_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2023-06-04T10:24:00-CME-001) is also predicted to have an impact at OSIRIS-REx at 2023-06-08T00:32Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20230604-AL-001).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-06-04_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179/Detailed_results_20230604_102400_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX179.txt \n###\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230604-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/25457/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-06-04T17:34Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-REx, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-06-04T17:34:46Z\n## Message ID: 20230604-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The energetic electron flux levels subsided to background levels early on 2023-05-28.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to minor this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-05-24  09:51:00  10:02:00  09:58:00   M1.0   N18W00 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-24  17:04:00  17:48:00  17:21:00   M1.8   N18W04 ( 13311 ) \n2023-05-25  14:37:00  14:53:00  14:46:00   M1.1   S25W06 ( 13312 ) \n2023-05-26  22:48:00  23:13:00  23:03:00   M1.3   S16E06 ( 13315 )  \n2023-05-28  10:21:00  10:55:00  10:36:00   M1.0   S15W14 ( 13315 ) \n2023-05-30  07:54:00  08:19:00  08:10:00   M1.2   S22W90 ( 13310 ) \n2023-05-30  10:15:00  10:29:00  10:22:00   M1.3   S22W90 ( 13310 ) \n2023-05-30  13:36:00  13:41:00  13:38:00   M1.4   S16W42 ( 13315 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-05-29T02:12Z     ~778            C                26/26                23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-05-24T00:24Z     ~907            C               -90/-19               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-24T02:00Z     ~589            C                41/27                13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-24T07:36Z     ~664            C              -105/42                13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-24T10:36Z     ~617            C              -145/-3                32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-25T08:24Z     ~548            C               125/-31               33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-25T21:53Z     ~1314           O              -124/1                 32                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-05-25T22:12Z     ~1349           O              -170/8                 45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-26T03:12Z     ~1655           O                85/-10               29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-26T03:24Z     ~1277           O               124/-6                48                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-05-27T12:24Z     ~655            C              -110/-14               31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-05-31T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-06-06T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary from moderate to high levels during the outlook period. There are 10 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13315 (currently at S17W58) and 13312 (currently at S25W82 - now decayed to a plage) showed the highest level flaring activity during the reporting period with two lower M-class flares each. Active Region 13315 may produce additional flaring before rotating off of the Earth-facing disk by 2023-06-03. On 2023-05-31, Active Regions 13323 (S03E76) and 13319 (S18W24) produced one lower M-class flare each and may continue to display increased activity through the remainder of the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be minor to moderate during the outlook period due to a possible glancing blow on 2023-06-01 from the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-05-29T02:12Z (see details mentioned above) and the anticipated arrival around 2023-06-03 of the coronal hole high speed stream from the large southern coronal hole currently centered around S35W05. Finally, there might be a minor enhancement in geomagnetic activity in the second half of the outlook period due to a possible glancing blow on 2023-06-04 from an S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-05-30T17:12Z.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"}]
