The highest value of Kp = 6 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-11-25T18:00Z-21:00Z. This enhanced geomagnetic activity was likely caused by the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2023-11-24 and the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-11-25T07:59Z which was likely associated with the arrival of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-11-22T21:36Z (see notification 20231125-AL-003). Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-11-25T09:28Z (see notifications 20231125-AL-002 and 20231125-AL-004). The arrival of this CME may have also been detected by STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments around 2023-11-25T04:30Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-11-24T14:15Z (see notifications 20231124-AL-001 and 20231124-AL-002). These elevated energetic electron flux levels are likely caused by the arrival of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-11-16T03:48Z detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2023-11-20T09:49Z and the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2021-11-21 observed during the previous reporting period. Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-11-22T05:40Z (see notifications 20231122-AL-001 and 20231122-AL-002) due to the arrival of this coronal hole high speed stream. The elevated > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES returned to background levels on 2023-11-25 and remained at background levels through the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-11-23  02:59:00  04:05:00  03:38:00   M1.4   N25E110 ( 13503 )\n2023-11-23  14:25:00  14:42:00  14:37:00   M1.0   N20E16 ( 13490 ) \n2023-11-24  09:17:00  09:43:00  09:33:00   M1.1   S18W02 ( 13499 ) \n2023-11-28  19:07:00  19:35:00  19:32:00   M3.4   S16W02 ( 13500 ) \n2023-11-28  19:35:00  20:09:00  19:50:00   M9.8   S16W03 ( 13500 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-11-22T21:36Z     ~665            C                 6/-31               49                          SOHO, STEREO A                                       \n2023-11-23T06:12Z     ~775            C               -60/-4                39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-24T10:12Z     ~833            C                14/-31               26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-27T06:48Z     ~556            C                10/-31               38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-27T20:12Z     ~500            C               -15/-4                39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-27T23:48Z     ~997            C               -37/38                32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-28T20:24Z     ~910            C                13/0                 45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-28T20:48Z     ~768            C                 2/-6                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-11-22T01:48Z     ~643            C               -50/9                 24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-22T06:48Z     ~702            C               -60/-54               41                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-23T02:00Z     ~704            C               110/36                28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-23T03:12Z     ~1215           O              -134/32                39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-23T06:00Z     ~984            C               -90/9                 27                          SOHO, STEREO A \n2023-11-24T07:36Z     ~694            C              -126/75                26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-11-29T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-12-05T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at low to moderate levels during the outlook period. Currently, there are numerous numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13500 (currently located at S19W15) produced 2 M-class flares during the reporting period and is likely to produce further flaring activity during the outlook period. Active Region 13499 (currently located at S17W70) produced C-class flares and one M-class flare during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit flaring activity before rotating off of the Earth-facing disk on or around 2023-12-01.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to reach minor or strong levels during the outlook period. A notable increase in geomagnetic activity may be observed around 2023-11-30 and 2023-12-01 due to the anticipated arrivals of the C-type CMEs from 2023-11-27 and 2023-11-28 previously described above. Additionally, a large coronal hole structure currently centered near S10W30 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) could become geoeffective towards the end of the outlook period on or around 2023-12-04.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20231129-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/27928/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-11-29T01:41Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (OSIRIS-APEX, Psyche, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-11-29T01:41:55Z\n## Message ID: 20231129-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 32 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge or flank of the CME will reach:\n- STEREO A between about 2023-11-29T08:14Z and 2023-11-30T06:24Z (average arrival 2023-11-29T18:30Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-11-29T10:25Z and 2023-11-30T12:18Z (average arrival 2023-11-29T21:47Z) for 100% of simulations.

This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 32 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-11-25T08:47Z and 2023-11-26T03:30Z (average arrival 2023-11-25T17:18Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-11-25T09:28Z and 2023-11-26T04:41Z (average arrival 2023-11-25T18:13Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 71% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-11-24_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA053/20231123_014000_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA053_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-11-24_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA053/20231123_014000_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA053_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-11-24_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA053/20231123_014000_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA053_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-11-24_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA053/20231123_014000_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA053_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-11-24_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA053/20231123_014000_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA053_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-11-24_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA053/20231123_014000_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA053_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

The highest value of Kp=4.33 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-11-21T06:00Z-09:00Z. This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was likely caused by the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-11-20T09:49Z which was associated with the arrival of the S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO imagery at 2023-11-16T03:48Z.

There are currently ten numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13490 (currently located at N20E27) and Active Region 13492 (N18E41) produced M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Additional flaring activity may occur throughout the outlook period from an unnumbered Active Region visible near the eastern limb around latitude S20 as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor to moderate levels during the outlook period. An enhancement in the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux is possible during the first half of the outlook period due to the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE around 2023-11-21T20:00Z which was associated with the high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-11-21. Following this arrival, simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-11-22T05:40Z (see notification 20231122-AL-001). Additionally, a coronal hole currently centered around N15E18 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2023-11-27.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"MPC","messageID":"20231122-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/27812/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-11-22T16:02Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Magnetopause Crossing\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-11-22T16:02:25Z\n## Message ID: 20231122-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate levels during this reporting period with 2 M-class flares and 5 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2023-11-09T12:23Z would impact NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-11-11T21:05Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 4-6 (below minor to moderate) (see notification 20231109-AL-002). An ensemble simulation was performed for this CME with 32 members which estimated the CME to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-11-11T11:35Z and 2023-11-12T00:18Z (average arrival 2023-11-11T18:24Z) for 100% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicated that there is a 93% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate). Full details of the modeled event are available here: https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-11-09_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA052/Detailed_results_20231109_122300_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA052.txt (see notification 20231110-AL-001). The arrival of this CME was likely detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-11-12T05:30Z. STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data may have also detected the arrival of this CME around 2023-11-12T03:48Z.\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CME would impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-11-09T12:23Z   OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-11-11T09:36Z, Psyche at 2023-11-11T22:29Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-11-11T05:44Z, and STEREO A at 2023-11-11T17:55Z (see notification 20231109-AL-002). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5.00 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5.00 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-11-13T00:00Z-03:00Z. This minor enhancement of geomagnetic activity was caused by the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-11-12T05:30Z which was likely associated with the arrival of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO imagery at 2023-11-09T12:23Z. The arrival of this CME may have also been detected by STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments around 2023-11-12T03:48Z. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES were elevated during the beginning of the reporting period. The elevated energetic electron flux levels observed since 2023-11-07T15:35Z were likely caused by the combined effects of the arrival of CMEs and coronal hole high speed stream which arrived during the previous reporting period (see notifications 20231107-AL-001, 20231107-AL-002, 20231109-AL-001, and 20231109-AL-001). The energetic electron flux levels later subsided to background levels towards the end of the reporting period on 2023-11-12.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A remained near or slightly above background levels throughout the entire reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-11-11  17:01:00  17:45:00  17:29:00   M1.2   S17W64 ( 13477 ) \n2023-11-14  22:58:00  23:09:00  23:05:00   M1.0   S17W75 ( 13485 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-11-09T12:23Z     ~782            C                10/14                45                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-11-08T07:24Z     ~871            C                88/12                34                          SOHO                              \n2023-11-14T04:00Z     ~582            C                65/-38               11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-14T11:24Z     ~574            C                71/-40               12                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-11-14T23:24Z     ~522            C                75/-28               23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-11-15T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date: 2023-11-21T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Active Regions 13486 (S08W48) and 13487 (S17W59) are currently the only two numbered active regions on the Earth-facing disk and both will likely exhibit C-class flaring activity during the outlook period. Previously numbered Active Region 13488 (N29E64) decayed to a plage towards the beginning of the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. As seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA, there are several small coronal hole structures currently visible on the Earth-facing disk and it is possible that some of these structures could become slightly geoeffective during the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20231111-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/27671/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-11-11T17:56Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-11-11T17:56:00Z\n## Message ID: 20231111-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

These elevated electron fluxes returned to background levels on 2023-11-04. Towards the end of the reporting period, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux crossed the 1000 pfu threshold at 2023-11-07T15:35Z (see notifications 20231107-AL-001 and 20231107-AL-002) due to the back-to-back arrivals of the C-type CMEs first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2023-11-02T03:36Z and 2023-11-03T05:48Z (previously described above) and a subsequent coronal hole high speed stream arrival detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE on 2023-11-06.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-11-01  06:07:00  06:49:00  06:26:00   M1.1   S15E80 ( 13477 ) \n2023-11-01  11:37:00  13:00:00  12:26:00   M1.4   S10E90 ( 13480 ) \n2023-11-02  12:18:00  12:26:00  12:22:00   M1.6   S18W35 ( 13474 ) \n2023-11-02  19:08:00  19:28:00  19:21:00   M1.0   S10E85 ( 13480 ) \n2023-11-05  11:34:00  11:47:00  11:43:00   M1.8   S09E52 ( 13480 ) \n2023-11-05  14:24:00  14:36:00  14:32:00   M1.6   S09E51 ( 13480 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-11-02T03:36Z     ~699            C               -20/35                35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-03T05:48Z     ~874            C                -3/21                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-11-02T19:48Z     ~611            C               -85/7                 17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-03T10:12Z     ~504            C               104/-38               41                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-04T05:12Z     ~572            C                -3/60                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-11-05T16:53Z     ~735            C               -55/32                25                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-11-06T07:36Z     ~595            C                62/-30               36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-11-08T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-11-14T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently six numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing solar disk. Active Region 13480 (S08E02) produced three of the 6 M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to show similar level flaring activity during the outlook period. Active Region 13483 (N10W09) and Active Region 13477 (S15W22) may also exhibit C-level and possible M-class flaring activity during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. The large coronal hole structure that crossed the Earth-facing central meridian on 2023-11-04 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) reached geoeffective longitudes towards the end of the reporting period and is associated with a coronal hole high speed stream arrival detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE on 2023-11-06. Continued influences from this associated coronal hole high speed stream may be observed during the beginning of the outlook period. A smaller coronal hole centered near S30E20 is anticipated to cross the central meridian on or around 2023-11-10 and may become geoeffective towards the end of the outlook period on or around 2023-11-14. Additionally, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt currently remains enhanced (see notifications 20231107-AL-001 and 20231107-AL-002) and this elevated electron flux may persist into the beginning of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20231107-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/27639/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-11-07T16:52Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-11-07T16:52:41Z\n## Message ID: 20231107-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-11-05T05:33Z and 2023-11-05T18:49Z (average arrival 2023-11-05T13:09Z) for 95% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-11-05T06:35Z and 2023-11-05T22:18Z (average arrival 2023-11-05T14:34Z) for 100% of simulations.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-11-04T15:45Z and 2023-11-04T23:44Z (average arrival 2023-11-04T19:13Z) for 41% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-11-04T16:09Z and 2023-11-05T03:10Z (average arrival 2023-11-04T20:19Z) for 70% of simulations.

The highest value of Kp=4.67 occurred during four synoptic periods. The value of Kp=4.67 occurring during the synoptic periods ending on 2023-10-26T12:00Z and 2023-10-27T00:00Z was likely caused by the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-10-26T03:43Z, which was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE on 2023-10-26. This interplanetary shock arrival may have also been detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data around 2023-10-26T11:10Z. Further enhancements in geomagnetic activity to Kp=4.67 occurred during the synoptic periods ending on 2023-10-29T03:00Z and 2023-10-29T09:00Z and was likely associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE on 2023-10-28. This coronal hole high speed stream arrival may have also been detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data on 2023-10-28. The solar wind speed reached values of around 550 km/s and 570 km/s, respectively. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-10-29T15:20Z (see notifications 20231029-AL-001 and 20231029-AL-002). Subsequently, towards the end of the reporting period, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux crossed the 1000 pfu threshold at 2023-10-31T12:50Z (see notification 20231031-AL-001). These elevated energetic electron flux levels are likely associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2023-10-28 described above. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above. \n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-10-26  22:47:00  00:20:00  23:24:00   M1.4   N20E90           \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-10-25T13:37Z     ~543            C               -90/-32               41                          SOHO                              \n2023-10-25T22:36Z     ~579            C                98/26                38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-26T23:14Z     ~1024           O               -90/39                52                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-27T15:12Z     ~539            C            NONE(POS)/28             22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-30T00:42Z     ~567            C            NONE(POS)/49             46                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-31T21:12Z     ~603            C               -90/-1                43                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-10-31T22:12Z     ~717            C                3/-32                29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-11-01T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-11-07T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently six numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing solar disk. The recent M-class flaring in the southeast may be attributable to Active Region 13477 (S15E80) and possibly an additional unnumbered region visible in SDO imagery near the eastern limb around latitude S10 and may continue throughout the outlook period. Additional minor flaring activity may occur throughout the outlook period from recently numbered Active Region 13478 (N12E70).\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A prominent coronal hole structure centered around S20E40 but with a portion extending meridionally through the equator to about N20 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective starting on or around 2023-11-07. Additional enhancements in geomagnetic activity may be observed during the outlook period in association with the potential arrival of a C-type CME first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-10-31T22:12Z. Additionally, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt remains enhanced at the start of the outlook period (see notifications 20231029-AL-001, 20231029-AL-002, and 20231031-AL-001) and this elevation is likely to persist into the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20231101-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/27536/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-11-01T15:56Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-11-01T15:56:27Z\n## Message ID: 20231101-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
