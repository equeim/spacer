At STEREO A, the flux of the 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-01-29T05:11Z (see notifications 20240129-AL-002 and 20240129-AL-004). At SOHO, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-01-29T06:08Z (see notification 20240129-AL-007). At GOES, the integral flux of the >10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2024-01-29T06:15Z (see notifications 20240129-AL-006 and 20240129-AL-008). This solar energetic particle event is associated with the M6.8 flare peaking at 2024-01-29T04:38Z from Active Region 13559 (N25W70) (see notifications 20240129-AL-001 and 20240129-AL-003) and subsequent O-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 coronagraph imagery at 2024-01-29T04:38Z (see notifications 20240129-AL-009 and 20240129-AL-010). The enhanced particle environment at STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES began to notably subside on 2024-01-30, decreasing below each spacecraftÂ’s respective threshold and remaining slightly elevated above background levels through the end of the reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle event detected at STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-01-24  00:21:00  00:43:00  00:38:00   M1.0   S17W43 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-24  01:31:00  01:53:00  01:40:00   M2.6   S16W48 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-24  05:18:00  06:00:00  05:43:00   M1.4   S16W51 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-24  20:44:00  21:11:00  20:58:00   M1.3   S18W60 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-29  01:29:00  01:52:00  01:40:00   M1.2   N30W61 ( 13559 ) \n2024-01-29  03:54:00  05:15:00  04:38:00   M6.8   N25W70 ( 13559 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-01-29T04:38Z     ~1277           O                64/3                 54                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-01-24T01:36Z     ~524            C                50/-44               27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-24T16:24Z     ~616            C                90/27                12                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-27T03:36Z     ~534            C              -175/51                30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-28T02:48Z     ~512            C              -110/-10               47                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-28T16:24Z     ~1197           O                55/28                16                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-28T20:36Z     ~675            C               -80/-58               24                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-29T02:00Z     ~936            C                65/12                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-29T07:36Z     ~657            C              -130/-49               35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-29T20:00Z     ~826            C             NONE(POS)/14            22                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-30T00:24Z     ~563            C                80/26                18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-30T01:25Z     ~594            C               -96/-21               20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-30T21:12Z     ~1014           O              -153/-4                45                          SOHO                              \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-01-31T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-02-06T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. There are currently five Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13559 and 13561, which were responsible for multiple M-class flares observed during the reporting period, have rotated off the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13567 (N20E58) has produced several C-class flares since rotating onto the Earth-facing disk around 2024-01-30 and may continue to exhibit flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A slight increase in geomagnetic activity could be observed on or around 2024-02-01 due to a possible glancing blow from the O-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2024-01-29T04:38Z (previously described above). Additionally, coronal hole structures currently centered near S18W20 and S35E15 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective during the outlook period on or around 2024-02-02 and 2024-02-04, respectively. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240131-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/28920/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-01-31T20:27Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Lucy, OSIRIS-APEX)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-01-31T20:27:24Z\n## Message ID: 20240131-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-01-22T13:42Z (see notification 20240122-AL-002). This solar energetic particle event may be associated with the C4.0 flare peaking at 2024-01-21T00:27Z and C5.3 flare peaking at 2024-01-21T00:41Z from Active Region 13559 and subsequent O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 coronagraph imagery at 2024-01-21T00:36Z (see notification 20240121-AL-001). The proton flux may have been further enhanced by the M1.5 flare which peaked at 2024-01-22T06:22Z from Active Region 13559. The energetic proton flux of the >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A were elevated during the reporting period, but remained below their respective thresholds of 10 pfu and 10^(-1) pfu/MeV. The particle environment subsided to background levels at all locations on 2024-01-23.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the solar energetic particle event detected at SOHO.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-01-22  06:09:00  06:30:00  06:22:00   M1.5   N27E27 ( 13559 ) \n2024-01-22  19:13:00  19:28:00  19:24:00   M1.1   N25E14 ( 13559 ) \n2024-01-22  19:28:00  19:36:00  19:32:00   M1.2   N25E14 ( 13559 ) \n2024-01-22  19:43:00  19:53:00  19:47:00   M2.0   S17W27 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-22  21:14:00  21:32:00  21:21:00   M3.4   S18W30 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-22  21:36:00  21:58:00  21:43:00   M1.6   S18W30 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-22  22:19:00  22:26:00  22:22:00   M2.1   S19W30 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  03:09:00  03:38:00  03:31:00   M5.1   N29E18 ( 13559 ) \n2024-01-23  07:52:00  08:18:00  08:11:00   M2.4   S18W38 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  08:18:00  08:26:00  08:22:00   M2.3   S18W40 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  13:03:00  13:13:00  13:08:00   M1.0   S18W38 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  14:45:00  15:05:00  14:59:00   M1.3   S18W42 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  16:36:00  16:47:00  16:40:00   M4.3   S17W39 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  18:19:00  18:35:00  18:28:00   M1.0   S17W43 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  18:35:00  18:49:00  18:44:00   M1.1   S16W43 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  19:46:00  19:57:00  19:52:00   M1.0   S17W42 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-23  19:57:00  20:05:00  20:01:00   M1.0   S17W44 ( 13561 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-01-20T09:24Z     ~978            C               -18/-22               47                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-21T00:36Z     ~1068           O               -33/-3                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-22T10:48Z     ~746            C                16/-38               42                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-22T22:36Z     ~563            C                29/-24               20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-23T03:48Z     ~771            C                -9/46                30                          SOHO           \n2024-01-23T04:12Z     ~613            C                26/-30               42                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-23T17:36Z     ~562            C                40/-33               40                          SOHO, STEREO A \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-01-18T13:25Z     ~772            C               -35/56                28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-20T09:36Z     ~584            C               -90/3                 35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-21T03:48Z     ~1180           O               -36/21                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-22T09:24Z     ~526            C               -63/47                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-22T19:00Z     ~654            C                90/40                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                                       \n2024-01-23T09:48Z     ~696            C               -16/62                20                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-23T13:36Z     ~629            C               -16/83                29                          SOHO                                                 \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-01-24T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-01-30T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently seven Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13559 (currently located at N27W12) and Active Region 13561 (currently located at S17W52) produced M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels for the upcoming week.

There are currently ten Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13540 (currently situated around S20W88) and Active Region 13541 (S22W85) have produced low-level C-class flaring towards the end of the reporting period and may continue to exhibit C-class flaring as they rotate beyond the west limb on 2024-01-17. An unnumbered Active Region visible near the eastern limb around latitude N25 (as seen in available EUV imagery from SDO) may exhibit flaring activity during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels for the upcoming week. A coronal hole currently centered around N05W60 (as seen in available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-01-17.

The solar energetic particle event was also detected by GOES at 2024-01-03T20:05Z, when the already elevated flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded the threshold of 10 pfu (see notifications 20240103-AL-003 and 20240103-AL-004). This solar energetic particle event was associated with the heightened activity from Active Region 13536: mainly the X5.0 flare close to the East limb in the previous reporting period (see notifications 20231231-AL-002 and 20231231-AL-003) and the associated R-type CME (see notification 20240101-AL-001), with possible additional contributions from the subsequent lower M-class flares from Active Region 13536. The energetic flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A was significantly elevated but remained below the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV. The proton fluxes at SOHO and GOES subsided to below their respective threshold levels on 2024-01-05. The energetic particle fluxes at all three locations have since decreased to background levels.  \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle events at SOHO and GOES described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-01-04  01:08:00  01:22:00  01:16:00   M1.1   N02E38 ( 13536 ) \n2024-01-04  01:22:00  02:12:00  01:55:00   M3.8   N04E38 ( 13536 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-01-06T08:12Z     ~706            C               -15/-10               10                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-01-04T00:00Z     ~732            C              -163/18                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-04T01:36Z     ~893            C              -121/24                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-05T01:53Z     ~552            C               -32/-14               22                          STEREO A                          \n2024-01-06T06:11Z     ~545            C              NONE(POS)/-12          25                          SOHO     \n2024-01-06T16:12Z     ~729            C              -149/33                17                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-08T13:25Z     ~571            C               -44/-32               31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-09T06:48Z     ~624            C                75/31                32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-09T15:48Z     ~674            C               -26/-36               41                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-01-10T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date: 2024-01-16T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period. Currently, there are ten numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13536 (N07W56) produced two M-class flares early in the reporting period as well as multiple C-class flares throughout it and will possibly generate some activity before it rotates off the Earth-facing disk on or around 2024-01-13. Active Region 13538 (N20W77) has been the source of C-class flaring but will soon be rotating behind the limb. Finally, a lower M-class flare was produced today by a yet unnumbered Active Region right on the Eastern limb (at around S20 latitude). This Active Region may exhibit flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. An increase in geomagnetic activity might be observed  at the beginning of the outlook period due to a possible glancing blow from the S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-01-06T17:36Z. Further increase in geomagnetic activity might happen on or around 2024-01-12 due to a possible glancing blow from the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-01-09T15:48Z mentioned above, possibly combined with an influence from the diffuse southern coronal hole which crossed the central meridian on 2024-01-09, as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA, and might become geoeffective on or around 2024-01-13. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240110-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/28551/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-01-10T18:52Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Psyche, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-01-10T18:52:27Z\n## Message ID: 20240110-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were 13 C-type CMEs and 1 R-type CME (see details below).\n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the R-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-12-31T22:00Z may give a glancing blow to NASA missions near Earth at about 2024-01-02T18:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 3-5 (below minor to minor) (see notification 20240101-AL-001). The arrival of this CME was possibly detected by DSCOVR at L1 at 2024-01-03T04:50Z (see notification 20240103-AL-002). Analysis of this arrival signature is ongoing. \n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact the following locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-12-27T01:48Z OSIRIS-APEX at 2023-12-28T18:31Z (see notification 20231227-AL-001).\n2023-12-27T04:00Z Mars at 2023-12-31T19:00Z (glancing blow).\n2023-12-31T10:00Z OSIRIS-APEX at 2024-01-01T23:31Z (see notification 20231231-AL-001).\n2023-12-31T22:00Z Solar Orbiter at 2024-01-02T07:00Z, Juno at 2024-01-11T00:18Z, Psyche at 2024-01-03T12:30Z (glancing blow), STEREO A at 2024-01-02T23:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20240101-AL-001).\n2024-01-02T11:09Z OSIRIS-APEX at 2024-01-04T06:00Z (glancing blow), Mars at 2024-01-07T03:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20240102-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4.00 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nDuring the reporting period, there was a solar energetic particle event detected by SOHO. At SOHO, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-01-02T23:22Z (see notification 20240103-AL-001). This solar energetic particle event may be associated with an X5.0 flare from AR 13536 (N04E80) which peaked at 2023-12-31T21:55Z (see notifications 20231231-AL-002 and 20231231-AL-003) along with an associated R-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-12-31T22:00Z (see notification 20240101-AL-001). The observed elevation in one or more of the >15.8 MeV proton channels was gradual and continued to oscillate around the 10^(-1) pfu/MeV threshold through the end of the reporting period. Analysis of this SEP event and all possibly associated activity is ongoing. The energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A were elevated above background levels during the latter part of the reporting period but did not exceed their respective thresholds of 10 pfu and 10^(-1) pfu/MeV before the end of the reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle event detected at SOHO.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-12-31  18:44:00  19:40:00  19:12:00   M1.0   N04E80 ( 13536 ) \n2023-12-31  21:37:00  22:08:00  21:55:00   X5.0   N04E80 ( 13536 ) \n2024-01-01  08:33:00  09:04:00  08:54:00   M2.3   N03E70 ( 13536 ) \n2024-01-01  11:54:00  12:35:00  12:25:00   M4.7   N03E68 ( 13536 ) \n2024-01-02  18:02:00  18:56:00  18:30:00   M1.1   N05E59 ( 13536 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-31T22:00Z     ~2184           R               -60/-14               45                          SOHO\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-12-27T01:48Z     ~508            C                77/2                 23                          SOHO, STEREO A     \n2023-12-27T03:12Z     ~537            C         NONE(POS)/-12               45                          SOHO                  \n2023-12-27T03:24Z     ~646            C              -164/-18               27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-27T03:36Z     ~516            C              -141/-11               22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-27T04:00Z     ~564            C               156/-32               25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-27T04:12Z     ~517            C              -159/-24               28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-29T02:48Z     ~771            C              -120/-18               34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-30T09:36Z     ~671            C               -30/-57               34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-12-30T19:24Z     ~765            C                45/65                24                          SOHO              \n2023-12-31T10:00Z     ~703            C                61/37                35                          SOHO, STEREO A \n2023-12-31T15:27Z     ~576            C         NONE(POS)/27                20                          SOHO\n2023-12-31T18:00Z     ~655            C         NONE(POS)/-63               16                          SOHO\n2024-01-02T11:09Z     ~617            C               122/-22               40                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-01-03T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-01-09T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. Currently, there are four numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13536 (N05E37) was responsible for the notable X-class and M-class flares observed during the reporting period and this region may continue to exhibit additional flaring activity as it transits the Earth-facing disk during the outlook period.\n \nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A coronal hole structure centered near S30E28 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) could become geoeffective during the latter part of the outlook period on or around 2023-01-07. Recently, the flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES exceeded the threshold of 10 pfu starting at 2024-01-03T20:05Z (see notifications 20240103-AL-003 and 20240103-AL-004). The >10 MeV integral proton flux at GOES is currently sustained above or near the 10 pfu threshold and this elevation may persist throughout the beginning part of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"SEP","messageID":"20240103-AL-004","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/28466/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-01-03T20:31Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - SEP\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-01-03T20:31:29Z\n## Message ID: 20240103-AL-004\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
