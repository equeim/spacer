The arrival of this CME may have been detected at L1 by ACE and DSCOVR at 2024-02-24T16:16Z (see notification 20240224-AL-001).\n\nIt was also estimated that the CMEs listed below would impact the following locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2024-02-21T18:36Z    STEREO A at 2024-02-24T14:26Z and Lucy at 2024-02-28T12:00Z (minor impact) (see notification 20240222-AL-003).\n2024-02-25T05:36Z    Lucy at 2024-03-03T06:00Z (minor impact), Mars at 2024-03-02T00:00Z (glancing blow), and OSIRIS-APEX at 2024-02-27T20:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20240225-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4.67 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp <= 4.67 occurred during the synoptic period 2024-02-27T03:00Z-06:00Z. This slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity may have been associated with the arrival of a weak transient event detected by ACE and DSCOVR at L1 on 2024-02-26.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A remained near or slightly above background levels for the entire reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to minor this reporting period.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-02-21  22:52:00  23:14:00  23:07:00   X1.8   N17E38 ( 13590 ) \n2024-02-21  23:58:00  00:31:00  00:14:00   M1.5   S36E90 ( 13591 ) \n2024-02-22  06:17:00  06:40:00  06:32:00   X1.7   N17E34 ( 13590 ) \n2024-02-22  20:29:00  21:03:00  20:46:00   M4.8   N17E26 ( 13590 ) \n2024-02-22  22:08:00  22:43:00  22:34:00   X6.3   N17E26 ( 13590 ) \n2024-02-23  13:12:00  13:54:00  13:28:00   M1.0   N17E17 ( 13590 ) \n2024-02-23  15:41:00  16:06:00  15:53:00   M1.4   N17E16 ( 13590 ) \n2024-02-23  16:12:00  16:37:00  16:20:00   M1.0   N17E15 ( 13590 ) \n2024-02-23  17:26:00  18:07:00  17:47:00   M2.6   N17E15 ( 13590 ) \n2024-02-24  06:21:00  06:44:00  06:34:00   M4.5   N18E09 ( 13590 ) \n2024-02-24  10:32:00  11:03:00  10:57:00   M2.2   N12E05 ( 13590 ) \n2024-02-24  11:03:00  11:25:00  11:18:00   M3.6   N18E05 ( 13590 ) \n2024-02-24  11:54:00  12:04:00  11:59:00   M1.0   N18E20 ( 13590 ) \n2024-02-25  16:47:00  17:47:00  17:22:00   M2.0   N18W10 ( 13590 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-02-21T18:36Z     ~576            C                40/-2                45                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-02-21T02:12Z     ~1116           O               -96/-66               23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-02-21T02:24Z     ~906            C               -95/-55               30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-02-21T16:12Z     ~880            C               -90/-61               31                          SOHO                              \n2024-02-21T17:34Z     ~627            C             NONE(POS)/34            26                          SOHO \n2024-02-22T00:24Z     ~1151           O               -92/-58               33                          SOHO                              \n2024-02-22T11:12Z     ~619            C               -90/-63               10                          SOHO                              \n2024-02-25T05:36Z     ~580            C                90/2                 29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-02-25T10:24Z     ~563            C               -53/-60               28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-02-28T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-03-05T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13590 (currently located at N18W48) produced ten M-class and three X-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Additionally, an unnumbered region visible near the eastern limb around latitude S20 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may exhibit activity as it rotates onto the Earth-facing disk.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A slight increase in geomagnetic activity may be observed around 2024-03-02 due to the anticipated arrival of a C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2024-02-28T09:24Z (see notification 20240228-AL-001).\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240228-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/29397/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-02-28T17:38Z","messageBody":"** The incorrect STEREO A arrival month has been updated in this notification.

Particle fluxes observed at all locations gradually subsided to near background levels through the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle events detected at SOHO, GOES, and STEREO A.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-02-14  03:02:00  03:23:00  03:10:00   M1.0   N07W26 ( 13582 ) \n2024-02-14  07:26:00  07:42:00  07:35:00   M1.0   S17W55 ( 13576 ) \n2024-02-15  16:50:00  17:21:00  17:07:00   M1.8   S15W80 ( 13576 ) \n2024-02-16  06:42:00  06:58:00  06:53:00   X2.5   S19W85 ( 13576 ) \n2024-02-16  21:57:00  22:16:00  22:09:00   M3.0   S16W94 ( 13576 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-02-16T03:12Z     ~726            C                20/41                38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-02-14T04:09Z     ~2012           R               168/-38               43                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2024-02-15T09:24Z     ~1953           O              -173/-22               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-02-15T23:12Z     ~570            C              -100/32                34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-02-16T01:36Z     ~1613           O              -171/-20               45                          SOHO                              \n2024-02-16T07:23Z     ~681            C                87/-35               45                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2024-02-16T17:36Z     ~565            C               -56/39                25                          SOHO                \n2024-02-16T23:12Z     ~563            C               POS/18                13                          SOHO              \n2024-02-17T13:16Z     ~1646           O              -168/-23               45                          SOHO                              \n2024-02-18T03:12Z     ~660            C              -130/-59               24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-02-18T10:00Z     ~1164           O              -136/-54               35                          SOHO, STEREO A    \n2024-02-18T12:12Z     ~725            C               POS/-60               16                          SOHO, STEREO A                \n2024-02-19T23:24Z     ~761            C                90/1                 35                          SOHO, STEREO A     \n2024-02-19T23:48Z     ~527            C               POS/-79               22                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2024-02-20T14:24Z     ~734            C               POS/24                21                          SOHO               \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-02-21T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-02-27T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently two numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13590 (N16E38) has recently produced many mid-level C-class flares and is likely to exhibit more flaring activity through the outlook period. An additional unnumbered active region observed towards the SE limb of the Earth-facing disk (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) has also been the source of recent C-class flaring and may continue to exhibit increased solar activity during the outlook period.\n \nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A coronal hole currently centered around S22E22 with a narrow extension towards the Earth-facing central meridian (as seen in available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2024-02-24.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240220-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/29316/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-02-20T21:01Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Lucy, OSIRIS-APEX, Mars)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-02-20T21:01:31Z\n## Message ID: 20240220-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp <= 4.33 occurred during the synoptic period of 2024-02-11T00:00Z-03:00Z. This slight enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2024-02-11T01:18Z which may have been associated with the shock arrival of the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-02-09T13:23Z (see notifications 20240209-AL-003, 20240209-AL-009, and 20240209-AL-011). Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2024-02-11T03:01Z (see notifications 20240211-AL-001 and 20240211-AL-004). This arrival was also detected by STEREO A at 2024-02-11T02:30Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period.\n\nTwo separate solar energetic particle events occurred during the reporting period, both of which were detected by STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES.\n\nThe first solar energetic particle event began on 2024-02-09 following the X3.3 flare peaking at 2024-02-09T13:14Z from Active Region 13575 (S37W110) (see notifications 20240209-AL-001 and 20240209-AL-002) and subsequent O-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-02-09T13:23Z (see notifications 20240209-AL-003, 20240209-AL-009, and 20240209-AL-011). The flux of the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV at 2024-02-09T15:09Z (see notifications 20240209-AL-005 and 20240209-AL-006). At GOES, the integral flux of the >10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2024-02-09T15:30Z (see notifications 20240209-AL-007 and 20240209-AL-008). At SOHO, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-02-09T15:52Z (see notification 20240209-AL-010). By the start of 2024-02-12, proton fluxes at GOES and STEREO A subsided to levels just below their respective threshold, while at SOHO the flux of the 15.8-39.8 MeV protons remained elevated, periodically hovering over the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV.\n\nThe second solar energetic particle event began on 2024-02-12 following the ER-type far-sided CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2024-02-12T06:36Z (see notification 20240212-AL-007). The flux of 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A and the flux of the 28.2-50.1 MeV protons at SOHO exceeded the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2024-02-12T07:41Z. At GOES the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded the threshold of 10 pfu starting at 2024-02-12T08:05Z and the flux of > 100 MeV protons briefly exceeded the threshold of 1 pfu at 2024-02-12T10:15Z (see notifications 20240212-AL-002, 20240212-AL-003, 20240212-AL-004, and 20240212-AL-006). The flux of > 100 MeV protons at GOES subsided below threshold levels after 2024-02-12T10:40Z while all other proton flux channels remained above their respective threshold levels at all three locations (GOES, SOHO, and STEREO A) through the remainder of the reporting period.\n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle events detected at STEREO A, GOES, and SOHO.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location

There are currently seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13575, which was responsible for multiple M-class flares and one X-class flare observed during the reporting period, rotated off the Earth-facing disk on 2024-02-08 and may continue to be the source of far-sided activity throughout the outlook period. Active Region 13576 (S17W63) and newly numbered Active Regions 13585 (N14E49) and 13586 (N25E70) have produced several M-class flares during the reporting period and are likely to exhibit additional flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. The SEP event observed during the reporting period on 2024-02-12 has and may continue to persist through the beginning of the outlook period. The integral flux of the >10 MeV protons at GOES and the 13-100 MeV proton flux at STEREO A recently subsided below their respective thresholds on 2024-02-14, but remain elevated above background levels. The flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV protons channels at SOHO are currently elevated near or just above the threshold of 10^(-1) pfu/MeV. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240214-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/29227/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-02-14T16:22Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Parker Solar Probe, Mars, OSIRIS-APEX)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-02-14T16:22:32Z\n## Message ID: 20240214-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There are currently ten Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13575 which was responsible for four most recent M-class flares, including an M5 class flare at the start of the outlook period, is rotating off of the Earth-facing disk today but could still produce some activity in the next two days. Active Region 13576 (S16E36) was responsible for the majority of M-class flaring observed during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit flaring activity as it transits the Earth-facing disk during the outlook period. One more unnumbered Active Region may soon be rotating onto the eastern limb around latitude N15 as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO.\n \nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at low to minor levels during the outlook period.

The enhanced particle environment at STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES began to notably subside on 2024-01-30, decreasing below each spacecrafts respective threshold and remaining slightly elevated above background levels through the end of the reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle event detected at STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2024-01-24  00:21:00  00:43:00  00:38:00   M1.0   S17W43 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-24  01:31:00  01:53:00  01:40:00   M2.6   S16W48 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-24  05:18:00  06:00:00  05:43:00   M1.4   S16W51 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-24  20:44:00  21:11:00  20:58:00   M1.3   S18W60 ( 13561 ) \n2024-01-29  01:29:00  01:52:00  01:40:00   M1.2   N30W61 ( 13559 ) \n2024-01-29  03:54:00  05:15:00  04:38:00   M6.8   N25W70 ( 13559 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-01-29T04:38Z     ~1277           O                64/3                 54                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2024-01-24T01:36Z     ~524            C                50/-44               27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-24T16:24Z     ~616            C                90/27                12                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-27T03:36Z     ~534            C              -175/51                30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-28T02:48Z     ~512            C              -110/-10               47                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-28T16:24Z     ~1197           O                55/28                16                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-28T20:36Z     ~675            C               -80/-58               24                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-29T02:00Z     ~936            C                65/12                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-29T07:36Z     ~657            C              -130/-49               35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-29T20:00Z     ~826            C             NONE(POS)/14            22                          SOHO                              \n2024-01-30T00:24Z     ~563            C                80/26                18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-30T01:25Z     ~594            C               -96/-21               20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2024-01-30T21:12Z     ~1014           O              -153/-4                45                          SOHO                              \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2024-01-31T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2024-02-06T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. There are currently five Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13559 and 13561, which were responsible for multiple M-class flares observed during the reporting period, have rotated off the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13567 (N20E58) has produced several C-class flares since rotating onto the Earth-facing disk around 2024-01-30 and may continue to exhibit flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A slight increase in geomagnetic activity could be observed on or around 2024-02-01 due to a possible glancing blow from the O-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2024-01-29T04:38Z (previously described above). Additionally, coronal hole structures currently centered near S18W20 and S35E15 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective during the outlook period on or around 2024-02-02 and 2024-02-04, respectively. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20240131-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/28920/1","messageIssueTime":"2024-01-31T20:27Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Lucy, OSIRIS-APEX)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2024-01-31T20:27:24Z\n## Message ID: 20240131-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
