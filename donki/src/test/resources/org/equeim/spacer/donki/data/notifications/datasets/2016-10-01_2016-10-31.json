This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low levels during this reporting period.  There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it was estimated that this C-type CME starting around 2016-10-25T19:12Z may impact STEREO A at 2016-10-28T21:35Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20161026-AL-004).  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at strong levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=7 for the reporting period.  Geomagnetic Kp index reached level 7 (strong) during the synoptic period of 2016-10-25T12:00Z-15:00Z.  It then reached moderate levels of Kp=6 on the following synoptic period and has remained between Kp=6 and Kp=5 ever since.  This strong increase in geomagnetic activity is associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2016-10-25 (see notifications 20161025-AL-001 and 20161025-AL-002).  The solar wind speed reached very high values of ~830 km/s at the end of the day on 2016-10-25.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained above the threshold level of 10^5 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period from 2016-10-19 to 2016-10-22 due to the effects of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2016-10-15 (see notifications 20161019-AL-001 and 20161021-AL-001).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the electron flux enhancement at the outer radiation belt described above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-10-25T19:12Z     ~560            C              -145/10                42                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-10-26T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-11-01T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week. The active region in the field view of STEREO A giving off the C-type CME mentioned above has potential for further eruptions. The Earth is expected to be impacted by additional high speed solar wind streams. Geomagnetic activity is currently moderate with Kp reaching level 6 during the synoptic period of 2016-10-26T09:00Z-12:00Z and with the > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux enhancement starting at 2016-10-26T11:00Z and ongoing, both events associated with the coronal hole high speed stream that started on 2016-10-25 (see notifications  20161026-AL-001, 20161026-AL-002, and 20161026-AL-003). \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

The geomagnetic Kp index reached level 6 (moderate) during the synoptic periods 2016-10-13T15:00Z to 2016-10-13T21:00Z and 2016-10-14T00:00Z to 2016-10-14T03:00Z.  The moderate geomagnetic activity was due to the arrival of a CME starting at the Sun on 2016-10-08T21:09Z that arrived at DSCOVR at L1 on 2016-10-12T21:21Z (see notification 20161013-AL-001).  Later, the geomagnetic Kp index reached level 5 (minor) during the synoptic periods 2016-10-16T18:00Z to 2016-10-16T21:00Z due to a high speed stream starting on 2016-10-15.\n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2016-10-17T12:10Z and remains elevated (see notifications 20161017-AL-001 - 003).  The enhancement is due to the high speed stream starting on 2016-10-15 and intesified to 750 km/s on 2016-10-16 and 2016-10-17.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week expcept for the periods of moderate geomagnetic activity and radiation belt electron flux enhancement described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-10-14T16:48Z     ~621            C               -93/-24               25                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-10-19T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-10-25T23:59Z\n \nSolar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week. Geomagnetic activity is expected to be moderate with > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux enhancement possible during the ongoing high speed stream that started on 2016-10-15.

There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at low levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt measured by GOES 13 crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2016-10-06T16:45Z in a continuation of the radiation belt enhancement that started on 2016-09-27T16:50Z (see notifications 20161003-AL-001, 20161006-AL-001, 20161006-AL-002 and 20161006-AL-003).  The elevated energetic electron flux levels were caused by the the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 starting at 2016-09-26T07:05Z, with additional influence from the flank impact of the CME with ID 2016-10-01T03:09:00-CME-001 that arrived around 2016-10-04T11:30Z (see notification 20161002-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevation of the electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt described above.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-10-05T11:12Z     ~517            C                93/0                 12                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-10-12T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-10-18T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming reporting period.  The active regions on the disk appear to have low magnetic complexity.  The geomagnetic activity is expected to be slightly elevated at the end of 2016-10-13 or the beginning of 2016-10-14 due to the influence of a slow coronal mass ejection detected by STEREO A/SOHO coronagraphs starting on 2016-10-08T21:09Z.  \n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
