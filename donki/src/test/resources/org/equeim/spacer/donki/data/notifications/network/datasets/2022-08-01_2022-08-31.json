There were 8 O-type CMEs and 10 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the O-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-08-27T02:23Z may affect Mars at 2022-08-29T19:52Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-28T21:14Z, STEREO B at 2022-08-29T06:29Z, Juno (glancing blow) at 2022-09-09T18:00Z, and NASA missions near Earth about 2022-08-29T11:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) with the roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index being 2-4 (see notification 20220827-AL-005). This CME event is associated with a M4.8 flare which peaked at 2022-08-27T02:40Z from Active Region 13088 (S29W62). Additionally, an ensemble simulation of this CME with 48 ensemble members was made (see notification 20220828-AL-001 and full details at https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146/Detailed_results_20220827_022300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146.txt). The arrival of this CME at L1 was likely detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2022-08-29T02:56Z (see notification 20220829-AL-001).\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2022-08-26T10:48Z    Solar Orbiter at 2022-08-28T11:30Z (see notification 20220827-AL-007)\n2022-08-26T13:48Z    Mars at 2022-08-31T04:59Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-29T00:18Z (see notification 20220826-AL-006)\n2022-08-28T16:23Z    OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-30T06:56Z and Mars at 2022-09-01T02:00Z (see notifications 20220828-AL-004 and 20220828-AL-005)\n2022-08-29T17:12Z    OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-31T21:08Z and Solar Orbiter at 2022-08-31T19:00Z (see notification 20220829-AL-004)\n2022-08-30T13:25Z    Solar Orbiter at 2022-09-01T12:23Z\n2022-08-30T18:24Z    Solar Orbiter at 2022-08-31T19:42Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2022-09-01T15:00Z (see notification 20220831-AL-001)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-08-27T09:00Z-15:00Z, 2022-08-29T03:00Z-06:00Z, and 2022-08-30T03:00-06:00Z. The slight increased of geomagnetic activity on 2022-08-27 may have been associated with the arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 of a coronal hole high speed stream that same day.  The latter increase on 2002-08-29 and 2022-08-30 may have been associated with the possible arrival of the CME first visible on 2022-08-27T02:23Z mentioned above (see notifications 20220827-AL-001, 20220829-AL-001, and 20220830-AL-001).\n\nSTEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments detected an interplanetary shock at 2022-08-25T08:04Z that may have been associated with the same coronal hole high speed stream described above. \n \nThe >2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was enhanced through the first part of the reporting period until 2022-08-27 due to a threshold crossing in the previous reporting period at 2022-08-19T12:40Z. These elevated energetic electron flux levels may have been caused by the combined arrival at L1 of a coronal hole high speed stream and two CMEs (see previous notifications (see notifications 20220814-AL-002, 20220814-AL-003, 20220815-AL-001, 20220816-AL-005, 20220817-AL-002).\n\nA solar energetic particle event was detected by SOHO and GOES during the reporting period. The flux of one or more of the SOHO >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2022-08-27T11:12Z, and the flux of the GOES >10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2022-08-27T11:55Z (see notifications 20220827-AL-002, 20220827-AL-003, and 20220827-AL-006). This solar energetic particle event was associated with the M4.8 flare from Active Region 13088 that peaked at 2022-08-27T02:40Z and the associated O-type CME first detected by STEREO A COR2A at 2022-08-27T02:23Z mentioned above. The energetic proton flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A was at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the solar energetic particle event described above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-08-25  19:39:00  20:02:00  19:51:00   M1.8   S25E65 ( 13089 )\n2022-08-25  23:21:00  23:32:00  23:27:00   M1.0   S24E61 ( 13089 )\n2022-08-26  10:41:00  11:05:00  10:55:00   M2.1   S24E50 ( 13089 ) \n2022-08-26  12:08:00  12:21:00  12:14:00   M7.2   S24E49 ( 13089 ) \n2022-08-26  12:24:00  12:38:00  12:31:00   M5.3   S24E49 ( 13089 ) \n2022-08-26  12:52:00  13:40:00  13:17:00   M3.6   S26W52 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-27  01:52:00  03:05:00  02:40:00   M4.8   S30W62 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-27  04:07:00  04:18:00  04:13:00   M1.3   S26W63 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-27  11:29:00  11:43:00  11:38:00   M1.2   S26W67 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-27  15:13:00  15:30:00  15:25:00   M1.1   S27W73 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-27  15:45:00  16:21:00  15:58:00   M1.8   S27W74 ( 13088 )\n2022-08-27  16:41:00  16:55:00  16:49:00   M1.1   S26W72 ( 13088 )\n2022-08-28  00:47:00  01:26:00  01:20:00   M1.4   S27W84 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-28  01:26:00  01:38:00  01:34:00   M1.4   S27W84 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-28  15:48:00  16:46:00  16:19:00   M6.7   S27W85 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-28  18:20:00  18:50:00  18:32:00   M4.6   S27W87 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-29  03:24:00  03:47:00  03:38:00   M3.3   S27W89 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-29  10:48:00  11:12:00  11:07:00   M8.6   S27W93 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-29  14:46:00  15:08:00  14:56:00   M2.5   S25W95 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-29  16:15:00  17:51:00  16:39:00   M3.8   S27W95 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-29  18:45:00  19:08:00  18:57:00   M4.7   S27W98 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-30  01:25:00  01:58:00  01:40:00   M1.6   S24W99 ( 13088 ) \n2022-08-30  01:58:00  02:24:00  02:13:00   M1.5   S24W99 ( 13088 )\n2022-08-30  18:05:00  21:23:00  19:29:00   M2.1   S24W99 ( 13088 )\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-08-27T02:23Z     ~1372           O                56/-13               40                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-08-26T10:48Z     ~790            C               141/-27               28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-26T13:48Z     ~768            C                73/-16               38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-27T10:00Z     ~523            C                70/-33               11                          SOHO                              \n2022-08-28T16:23Z     ~1148           O                80/-8                37                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-08-29T06:24Z     ~880            C               -43/52                23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-29T07:36Z     ~774            C               -90/-30               11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-29T15:36Z     ~1149           O               114/-43               12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-29T17:12Z     ~949            C                97/-18               30                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-08-29T18:36Z     ~646            C                65/16                17                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-08-29T20:00Z     ~1154           O                NONE/-48             10                          SOHO\n2022-08-29T21:12Z     ~1409           O                NONE/-50             15                          SOHO\n2022-08-30T03:36Z     ~928            C                NONE/-41             10                          SOHO\n2022-08-30T06:12Z     ~1026           O                NONE/-43             14                          SOHO\n2022-08-30T12:36Z     ~637            C                151/-57              14                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-08-30T13:25Z     ~645            C                143/18               27                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-08-30T18:24Z     ~1533           O                149/-15              50                          SOHO, STEREO A              \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-08-31T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-09-06T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are two Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk, and several Active Regions near the STEREO A-facing eastern limb (approximately E80 and E95) that may rotate onto the Earth facing-disk around 2022-09-02. Active Region 13089 (S22W06) is the most magnetically complex region and may continue to be active through the outlook period. Active Region 13088, which was responsible for much of the flaring activity in the current period, has rotated off the Sun's western limb as seen from SDO imagery, but it may continue to produce eruptive activity away the Sun-Earth line.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between below minor and minor levels throughout the outlook period. There is a prominent equatorial coronal hole approaching the Sun's central meridian in SDO AIA 193 and in STEREO A EUVI 195 whose leading edge extends currently close to N10E15. This coronal hole may possibly become geoeffective around 2022-09-05.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220831-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21487/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-08-31T17:26Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (OSIRIS-REx, Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-08-31T17:26:53Z\n## Message ID: 20220831-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B and Mars. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO B between about 2022-08-28T21:16Z and 2022-08-29T12:06Z (average arrival 2022-08-29T04:51Z) for 29% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2022-08-29T13:41Z and 2022-08-30T14:40Z (average arrival 2022-08-30T01:18Z) for 87% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-08-28T21:36Z and 2022-08-28T21:36Z (average arrival 2022-08-28T21:36Z) for 2% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 100% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146/20220827_022300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146/20220827_022300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146/20220827_022300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146/20220827_022300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146/20220827_022300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146/20220827_022300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146_Mars_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146/20220827_022300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146/20220827_022300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2022-08-27T02:23:00-CME-001) is also predicted to have impacts at Juno (glancing blow) at 2022-09-09T18:00Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-28T21:14Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling.  A possible arrival at Parker Solar Probe around 2022-08-28T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) was also indicated by previous heliospheric modeling, but PSP has been removed from the simulation outputs due to its perihelion pass taking it inside the ENLIL inner boundary (see notification 20220827-AL-005).\n\nThis CME event (2022-08-27T02:23:00-CME-001) is associated with M4.8 flare with ID 2022-08-27T01:52:00-FLR-001 which peaked at 2022-08-27T02:40Z, SEP at GOES-P with ID 2022-08-27T11:55:00-SEP-001 (see notifications 20220827-AL-002 and 20220827-AL-003), and SEP at SOHO with ID 2022-08-27T11:12:00-SEP-001 (see notification 20220827-AL-006).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-08-27_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146/Detailed_results_20220827_022300_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX146.txt\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220827-AL-007","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21401/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-08-27T18:47Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-08-27T18:47:29Z\n## Message ID: 20220827-AL-007\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This CME was associated with an M1.3 flare which peaked at 2022-08-18T10:09Z and possibly an M1.5 flare which peaked at 2022-08-18T10:55Z, both from Active Region 13078 (S25W35). Additionally, an ensemble simulation of this CME with 32 ensemble members was made (see notification 20220819-AL-003 and full details at https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-08-18_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX145/Detailed_results_20220818_110000_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX145.txt).  The arrival of this CME at L1 was likely detected by DSCOVR and ACE around 2022-08-20T17:24Z.  Analysis of this arrival is still ongoing.  \n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Impact(s) (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2022-08-17T14:53Z    Mars at 2022-08-21T15:12Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2022-08-18T20:42Z, STEREO A at 2022-08-20T17:30Z, STEREO B at 2022-08-20T05:15Z (see notification 20220817-AL-004)\n2022-08-18T12:48Z    OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-20T19:12Z (see notification 20220819-AL-001)\n2022-08-19T00:24Z    Mars at 2022-08-22T16:44Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2022-08-20T11:11Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-21T20:00Z, STEREO B at 2022-08-22T04:00Z (see notifications 20220819-AL-005 and 20220821-AL-001)\n2022-08-19T07:30Z    Mars at 2022-08-22T16:44Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2022-08-20T11:11Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-21T20:00Z, STEREO B at 2022-08-22T04:00Z (see notifications 20220819-AL-005 and 20220821-AL-001)\n2022-08-19T11:38Z    Mars at 2022-08-22T16:44Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2022-08-20T11:11Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-21T20:00Z, STEREO B at 2022-08-22T04:00Z (see notifications 20220819-AL-005 and 20220821-AL-001)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (ranging 0-9) <= 6 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp = 6 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-08-17T18:00Z to 2022-08-18T00:00Z (see notifications 20220817-AL-005 and 20220817-AL-006).  This moderate geomagnetic storm may have been associated with the combined arrival of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-08-13T18:48Z (see notifications 20220814-AL-002, 20220815-AL-001, and 20220816-AL-005) and the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-08-14T12:48Z (see notification 20220814-AL-003), with an associated interplanetary shock at 2022-08-17T02:14Z (see notification 20220817-AL-002).  It may also have been enhanced by the subsequent arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 that same day on 2022-08-17, reaching a maximum speed of approximately 637 km/s.\n\nAdditionally, we have a minor elevation of geomagnetic activity with Kp = 5 during the synoptic periods of 2022-08-18T12:00Z-18:00Z and 2022-08-19T18:00Z-21:00Z.  The latest period of elevated geomagnetic activity may have been associated with the combined arrival of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-08-16T02:24Z (see notifications 20220816-AL-006 and 20220818-AL-001), and the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-08-16T15:24Z (see notifications 20220817-AL-003 and 20220818-AL-002), with an associated interplanetary shock at 2022-08-19T17:02Z (see notification 20220819-AL-004).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2022-08-19T12:40Z and remained elevated through the end of the reporting period.  The elevated energetic electron flux levels were caused by the aforementioned combined arrival of two CMEs and the high speed stream which arrived on 2022-08-17 (see notifications 20220819-AL-002, 20220821-AL-001 and 20220823-AL-001).  The energetic electron flux levels may have been further enhanced by the combined arrival of two CMEs on 2022-08-19 mentioned above and the weak arrival detected at L1 on 2022-08-20T17:24Z of the O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-08-18T11:00Z.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux levels in the Earth's outer radiation belt mentioned above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-08-17  13:26:00  13:50:00  13:45:00   M2.0   S21W25 (13078) \n2022-08-17  14:28:00  15:10:00  14:52:00   M1.0   S22W26 (13078) \n2022-08-18  10:04:00  10:13:00  10:09:00   M1.3   S25W35 (13078) \n2022-08-18  10:37:00  11:13:00  10:55:00   M1.5   S25W35 (13078) \n2022-08-18  14:02:00  14:18:00  14:13:00   M1.3   S23W37 (13078) \n2022-08-19  04:14:00  05:18:00  04:44:00   M1.6   S24W49 (13078) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-08-17T14:53Z     ~767            C                18/-26               49                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-18T11:00Z     ~1313           O                 7/-14               49                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-19T00:24Z     ~597            C                46/-32               26                          SOHO                              \n2022-08-19T07:30Z     ~878            C                49/-33               47                          SOHO                              \n2022-08-19T11:38Z     ~834            C                53/-24               34                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-08-18T12:48Z     ~790            C                90/3                 18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-20T00:24Z     ~573            C                61/-36               20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-22T06:36Z     ~530            C               -90/-49               10                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-08-24T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-08-30T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are five Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk.  Active Region 13085 (N25W08) is the largest and most magnetically complex region, and has produced the majority of the C-class flaring towards the second half of the reporting period. This Active Region may continue to be active through the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between below minor and minor levels throughout the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt currently remains elevated above 1000 pfu and may remain elevated throughout the beginning of the outlook period. There is a coronal hole visible in the SE in SDO AIA 193 and in STEREO A EUVI 195 that mostly surrounds Active Region 13086 (S21E44) and that extends close to S22E25 at the end of the reporting period. This coronal hole may possibly become geoeffective around 2022-08-30.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20220823-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21318/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-08-23T12:55Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-08-23T12:55:29Z\n## Message ID: 20220823-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This CME event (2022-08-18T11:00:00-CME-001) is associated with an M1.3 flare with ID 2022-08-18T10:04:00-FLR-001 which peaked at 2022-08-18T10:09Z from AR 13078 (S25W35) and possibly the M1.5 flare with ID 2022-08-18T10:37:00-FLR-001 which peaked at 2022-08-18T10:55Z from AR 13078 (S25W35).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-08-18_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX145/Detailed_results_20220818_110000_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX145.txt\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20220819-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21282/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-08-19T13:34Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-08-19T13:34:49Z\n## Message ID: 20220819-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There are several Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13078 (S23W28) is the most magnetically complex and produced 5 M-class flares and many C-class flares towards the second half of the reporting period. Recently numbered Active Region 13082 (N27E40) has been the source of low-level C class flaring. Both regions may continue to be active through the outlook period. Additionally, a couple of unnumbered Active Regions recently rotated onto the Earth-facing disk as seen towards the SE limb in the available EUV imagery from SDO near S10E40 and S20E70 and they may continue to develop during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There was an interplanetary shock arrival on 2022-08-17 detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE that may be associated with CME first visible at 2022-08-13T18:48Z and CME first visible at 2022-08-14T12:48Z and possibly a large coronal hole structure passing through the Earth-facing central meridian starting on 2022-08-14. The solar wind signature is still developing and analysis is currently ongoing (see notification 20220817-AL-002). Additional coronal hole structures passing through the Earth-facing central meridian on 2022-08-16 near latitudes N35 and S30 may become geoeffective on or around 2022-08-20. Elevated geomagnetic activity may also be expected due to the predicted arrivals of the additional Earth-directed CMEs mentioned in the above table. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt currently remains elevated around or above 1000 pfu and may remain elevated throughout the beginning of the outlook period (see notification 20220816-AL-002).\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"GST","messageID":"20220817-AL-005","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21255/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-08-17T21:32Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Auto-generated Space Weather Notification - Geomagnetic Storm\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-08-17T21:32:58Z\n## Message ID: 20220817-AL-005\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were 6 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 6 occurred during the synoptic period from 2022-08-07T21:00Z to 2022-08-08T00:00Z (see notifications 20220808-AL-001 and 20220808-AL-002). This geomagnetic storm was likely caused by a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-08-07, reaching a maximum speed of approximately 668 km/s, with an associated interplanetary shock at 2022-08-07T00:45Z (see notification 20220807-AL-001). STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments detected an interplanetary shock at 2022-08-04T10:39Z that may have also been associated with the same coronal hole high speed stream arrival.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2022-08-08T15:00Z and remained elevated through the end of the reporting period.  The elevated energetic electron flux levels were caused by the aforementioned coronal hole high speed stream which arrived on 2022-08-07, reaching a maximum speed of approximately 668 km/s (see notifications 20220808-AL-003, 20220808-AL-004 and 20220810-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement at the end of the reporting period described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-08-06T01:48Z     ~912            C               -44/-23               39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-08-05T22:24Z     ~934            C                66/-55               10                          SOHO                              \n2022-08-06T08:53Z     ~595            C                40/-55               25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-07T11:00Z     ~776            C               -35/-33               20                          SOHO                              \n2022-08-08T11:53Z     ~893            C                 0/54                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-08T13:25Z     ~685            C                15/51                19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-08-10T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-08-16T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. There are currently four numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk, but all are relatively quiet. Two unnumbered Active Regions have just rotated onto the eastern limb near latitude S10 and N15, as seen in SDO AIA 193 imagery. An unnumbered Active Region currently rotating onto the eastern limb in STEREO A EUVI 195 near latitude S15 may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2022-08-12.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. The coronal hole high speed stream observed at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE on 2022-08-07, mentioned above, may remain geoeffective until around 2022-08-11, as shown in the ambient ENLIL simulation outputs.  The associated radiation belt enhancement, also mentioned above, may remain for most of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20220810-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/21158/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-08-10T13:02Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-08-10T13:02:19Z\n## Message ID: 20220810-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO A between about 2022-08-07T19:06Z and 2022-08-08T08:29Z (average arrival 2022-08-08T03:20Z) for 54% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-08-08T07:08Z and 2022-08-08T07:08Z (average arrival 2022-08-08T07:08Z) for 4% of simulations.

There were 2 O-type CMEs and 15 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the following non-Earth directed CMEs were predicted to impact: \n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Mission Impact (plus minus 7 hours)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n2022-07-27T04:00Z    Mars at 2022-07-31T05:09Z; OSIRIS-REx at 2022-07-29T17:00Z; Parker Solar Probe at 2022-07-29T06:00Z; (see notification 20220727-AL-002)\n2022-07-27T18:48Z    Parker Solar Probe at 2022-07-29T20:44Z; STEREO B at 2022-07-31T00:00Z; (see notification 20220728-AL-001)\n2022-07-28T14:36Z    OSIRIS-REx at 2022-07-31T15:00Z;\n2022-07-29T00:36Z    Mars at 2022-08-02T10:00Z; Parker Solar Probe at 2022-07-31T12:00Z; STEREO B at 2022-08-01T19:00Z; (see notification 20220729-AL-001)\n2022-07-29T13:08Z    OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-01T05:30Z; (see notification 20220729-AL-002)\n2022-08-01T01:48Z    OSIRIS-REx at 2022-08-04T04:00Z; Solar Orbiter at 2022-08-03T22:30Z \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic period from 2022-07-31T15:00Z-18:00Z. This slightly elevated value of Kp may have been caused by the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-07-31, reaching a maximum speed of approximately 557 km/s, with an associated interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-07-31T08:20Z (see notification 20220731-AL-001). The current solar wind speed detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 is approximately 500 km/s. STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments detected an interplanetary shock at 2022-07-28T07:17Z that may have also been associated with the previously mentioned coronal hole high speed stream. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was enhanced through the first part of the reporting period until 2022-07-31 due to a threshold crossing in the previous reporting period at 2022-07-25T14:05Z. These elevated energetic electron flux levels were likely caused by the combined arrival of two CMEs detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-07-23 (see notifications 20220725-AL-002, 20220725-AL-003, 20220727-AL-001, and 20220730-AL-001)\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement at the beginning of the reporting period described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-07-27T04:00Z     ~781            C                52/32                26                          SOHO                              \n2022-07-27T18:48Z     ~684            C                27/-15               17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-28T14:36Z     ~562            C                91/8                 10                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-07-28T19:53Z     ~588            C              NONE/-71               10                          STEREO A, SOHO                     \n2022-07-29T00:36Z     ~630            C                39/-21               20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-29T13:08Z     ~769            C               109/9                 20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-29T15:12Z     ~629            C               -63/-26               10                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-07-30T02:53Z     ~552            C              -172/-26               59                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-07-30T05:53Z     ~711            C              -151/-1                18                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-07-30T12:38Z     ~518            C              -151/6                 17                          STEREO A                          \n2022-07-31T01:25Z     ~832            C               122/-2                11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-31T19:48Z     ~531            C              -124/-38               14                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-07-31T23:12Z     ~1038           O               -95/16                29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-08-01T03:24Z     ~545            C               121/4                 14                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-08-01T06:12Z     ~749            C              NONE/5                 18                          SOHO\n2022-08-02T06:36Z     ~579            C              NONE/24                17                          SOHO\n2022-08-02T06:48Z     ~1024           O               -80/12                14                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-08-03T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-08-09T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently five numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13067 (N19W35), 13069 (S18W72), and 13070 (N15E27) have decayed to plages and exhibit a low probability for flaring activity. Active Region 13068 (S15W21) has been the source of recent C-class flaring and may continue to be active during the outlook period. Active Region 13071 (S22E68) was recently numbered and may also exhibit some flaring activity during the outlook period. As seen in STEREO A EUVI 195 imagery, two unnumbered Active Regions observed on the eastern limb near latitudes S12 and N25 may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk during the first part of the outlook period on or around 2022-08-05.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels throughout the outlook period. A coronal hole structure passing through the Earth-facing central meridian on 2022-08-02 as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO near latitude N35 may become geoeffective on or around 2022-08-04. Additionally, two coronal hole structures visible in the eastern hemisphere of the Earth-facing disk near latitudes N05 and S35 may become geoeffective in the latter part of the outlook period on or around 2022-08-08. The arrival of a solar sector boundary crossing during the outlook period on or around 2022-08-05 is possible as shown in the ambient ENLIL simulation outputs.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"}]
