Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and ensemble heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the CME starting at 2021-04-22T05:23Z may impact missions near Earth with an average arrival around 2021-04-24T19:25Z and an average arrival at STEREO-A around 2021-04-25T00:59Z (See notifications 20210422-AL-001 and 20210423-AL-001). The second C-type CME that started on 2021-04-25T13:25Z was estimated to impact STEREO-A around 2021-04-28T08:43Z (plus/minus 7 hours).  A CME arrival was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2021-04-24T22:24Z associated with the CME that started on 2021-04-22T05:23Z (see notification 20210425-AL-001).  The STEREO A IMPACT instrument also detected a CME arrival on 2021-04-28T02:58Z associated with the CME that started on 2021-04-25T13:25Z. \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest values of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods 2021-04-23T21:00Z-24:00Z, 2021-04-25T00:00Z-03:00Z, and 2021-04-26T03:00Z-06:00Z. These elevated values of Kp were associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-04-23, as well as the arrival at 2021-04-24T22:24Z of the CME that started on 2021-04-22T05:23Z. Solar wind speeds reached values around 550 km/s during the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was elevated above the threshold level of 1000 pfu throughout the first half of the reporting period until 2021-04-25. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt were associated with the combination of the continued influence of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-04-17 and the second coronal hole high speed stream detected around 2021-04-23 (see notifications 20210421-AL-002 and 20210423-AL-002).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO-A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to elevated energetic electron fluxes on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-04-22T05:23Z     ~803            C               -13/-8                30                          SOHO, STEREO-A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-04-25T13:25Z     ~652            C              -41/-15                23                          SOHO                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-04-28T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-05-04T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period.  There are several active regions present on the solar surface as seen in the available imagery with the potential to produce flares and coronal mass ejections. Active Region 12816 produced two C-class flares during the reporting period, but is due to rotate off of the Earth-facing disk near the beginning of the outlook period.  Active Region 12820 produced several B-class flares during the reporting period and may produce several B- and C-class flares early in the outlook period.  There are a couple of unnumbered active regions about to rotate onto the STEREO-A-facing disk that may produce some minor flaring activity.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels for the outlook period.  Potential causes of enhanced geomagnetic activity include the possible arrival of a high speed stream from a coronal hole near center disk on 2021-04-28, which may become geoeffective around 2021-05-02.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20210428-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/16809/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-04-28T19:15Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-04-28T19:15:34Z\n## Message ID: 20210428-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt were associated with the combination of the two coronal hole high speed streams mentioned above detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-04-16 and 2021-04-17, respectively.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to elevated energetic electron fluxes on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2021-04-19  23:19:00  23:59:00  23:42:00   M1.1   S24E23 ( 12816 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-04-20T00:12Z     ~583            C               -37/-7                28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-04-17T16:36Z     ~710            C              -110/-4                41                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-04-21T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-04-27T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period.  There are several active regions present at the solar surface as seen on the available imagery with the potential to produce flares and coronal mass ejections. Active Region 12817 produced several B-class flares and a C-class flare near the end of the reporting period and may continue to produce B-class and possibly C-class flares early on in the outlook period as it rotates off of the Earth-facing disk.  Active Region 12816 produced an M-class flare on 2021-04-19 and may produce several B and C-class flares throughout the reporting period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels for the reporting period.  Potential causes of enhanced geomagnetic activity include the possible arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream observed to the NW of active region 12816 centered around S15W30 on 2021-04-21 as seen from the Earth facing disk that may become geoeffective around late 2021-04-23.  A southern extension of the northern pole coronal hole may also become geoeffective by the end of the outlook period.  The geomagnetic activity could also be slightly enhanced by the glancing blow impact from the 2021-04-20T00:12Z C-type CME mentioned above.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20210421-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/16766/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-04-21T17:55Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-04-21T17:55:55Z\n## Message ID: 20210421-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis of the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2021-04-22T16:29Z and 2021-04-23T02:47Z (average arrival 2021-04-22T21:41Z) for 93% of simulations.\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-04-20_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA003/20210420_001200_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA003_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-04-20_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA003/20210420_001200_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA003_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-04-20_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA003/20210420_001200_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA003_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.
