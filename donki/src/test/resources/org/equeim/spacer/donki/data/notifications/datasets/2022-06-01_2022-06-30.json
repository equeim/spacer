This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low levels during this reporting period.  There were 7 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, a combined simulation of a C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-06-24T18:09Z and an S-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-06-24T18:38Z estimated that the combined leading edge of the CMEs may impact Parker Solar Probe at 2022-06-27T02:17Z and may give a glancing blow to STEREO B at 2022-06-28T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours).\n\nIt was also estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-06-26T03:36Z may impact Solar Orbiter at 2022-06-28T07:46Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220626-AL-003).\n\nAdditionally, a simulation of a C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-06-26T11:09Z estimated that the leading edge of the CME would reach Parker Solar Probe at 2022-06-28T05:01Z and give glancing blows to Mars at 2022-07-01T10:30Z and STEREO B at 2022-06-29T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours).\n\nTwo narrow C-type CMEs first detected in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-06-28T19:00Z and SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-06-28T23:12Z were simulated together and it was estimated that the combined leading edge of the CMEs will reach Mars at 2022-07-02T14:51Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2022-07-01T14:51Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220629-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 5 for the reporting period. The highest values of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods 2022-06-25T21:00Z to 2022-06-26T03:00Z. These slightly elevated values of Kp were possibly caused by the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 on 2022-06-25 associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-06-25T08:30Z (see notification 20220625-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected at GOES remained elevated above 1000 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period. These elevated energetic electron flux levels were a continuation of the enhancement observed since 2022-06-18T12:35Z and were associated with a CME arrival at L1 starting on 2022-06-15 and a coronal hole high speed stream arrival on 2022-06-12. These elevated electron flux levels were enhanced on 2022-06-26 due to the arrival of the CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-06-21T00:48Z and further enhanced throughout the remainder of the reporting period due to the coronal hole high speed stream first observed in DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-06-25 (see notifications 20220626-AL-004 and 20220628-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux levels described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-06-23T00:24Z     ~602            C                20/-33               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-06-23T08:36Z     ~692            C                90/-51               10                          SOHO                              \n2022-06-24T18:09Z     ~574            C                82/-22               18                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-06-26T03:36Z     ~950            C               148/-36               51                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-06-26T11:09Z     ~671            C                36/35                29                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-06-28T19:00Z     ~582            C                78/3                 17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-06-28T23:12Z     ~970            C                81/8                 17                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-06-29T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-07-05T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently four numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13040 (S12W35) has produced multiple B-class flares in the past two days and will likely remain active during the outlook period. Active Region 13041 (N15W93) has rotated off the Earth-facing disk. Additionally, an unnumbered Active Region observed near the eastern limb in STEREO A EUVI 195 imagery (near a latitude of N30) may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2022-07-01.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. The current elevation of the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux at GOES associated with the coronal hole high speed stream arrival on 2022-06-25 may persist during the outlook period. Finally, a small coronal hole visible on the Earth-facing disk near S25E15 may reach a geoeffective longitude by 2022-07-04 and a larger coronal hole located at N25E50 may become geoeffective by 2022-07-05.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220629-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/20660/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-06-29T13:53Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (Mars, OSIRIS-REx)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-06-29T13:53:30Z\n## Message ID: 20220629-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at minor level during this reporting period with 1 M-class flare (see list below).  There were 6 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-06-19T21:53Z may arrive as glancing blows at STEREO A at 2022-06-22T20:00Z and NASA missions near Earth at 2022-06-22T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220620-AL-001). The roughly estimated predicted range of the maximum Kp index was 3-5 (below minor to minor). Additionally, an ensemble simulation of this CME with 48 ensemble members estimated that the flank of the CME may impact STEREO A between about 2022-06-22T18:15Z and 2022-06-23T00:47Z (average arrival 2022-06-22T21:19Z) for 31% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-06-22T10:28Z and 2022-06-22T16:51Z (average arrival 2022-06-22T13:37Z) for 45% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicated a 100% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate) (see notification 20220620-AL-005).  The arrival of this CME at L1 may possibly have been detected by DSCOVR at 2022-06-22T11:27Z, but this weak arrival signature is still developing and analysis is still ongoing.\n\nIt was also estimated that the C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-06-20T15:23Z may impact Parker Solar Probe at 2022-06-22T11:19Z, Mars (glancing blow) at 2022-06-24T10:00Z, and STEREO B (glancing blow) at 2022-06-24T05:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notifications 20220620-AL-006, 20220620-AL-007).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic period 2022-06-15T12:00Z-15:00Z. This minor geomagnetic storm was likely caused by the arrival of the O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-06-13T03:12Z.  This arrival was associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-06-15T04:01Z (see notification 20220615-AL-001).\n\nIn addition, a possible arrival of a high speed stream at L1 detected by DSCOVR and ACE on 2022-06-20 was associated with a strong compression of the magnetosphere.  Simulations carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2022-06-20T14:43Z (see notifications 20220620-AL-003, 20220620-AL-004).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2022-06-18T12:35Z and remained elevated through the remainder of the reporting period.  The elevated energetic electron flux levels may have been caused by the combined effects of the aforementioned CME arrival at L1 starting on 2022-06-15 and the high speed stream arrival on 2022-06-12 (see notifications 20220618-AL-001, 20220618-AL-002, 20220620-AL-002).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels through the end of the reporting period following a slight elevation above background levels from 2022-06-13 until 2022-06-17. Both fluxes remained below their respective thresholds for the entire reporting period.  These slightly elevated proton fluxes were associated with the aforementioned O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-06-13T03:12Z and with the associated M3.4 class flare from Active Region 13032 peaking at 2022-06-13T03:01Z.\n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the RBE and the modeled magnetopause crossing, both mentioned above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-06-16  03:47:00  03:57:00  03:53:00   M1.6   S29W14 (13031) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-06-19T21:53Z     ~809            C               -12/6                 10                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-06-15T23:12Z     ~562            C              -119/20                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-06-17T05:12Z     ~615            C               158/38                27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-06-17T13:48Z     ~876            C                87/-51               31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-06-19T00:12Z     ~725            C              NONE/19                16                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-06-20T15:23Z     ~531            C                44/24                23                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-06-22T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-06-28T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently several numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk, but only Active Region 13038 (N14W21) is expected to produce any significant activity during the outlook period.  Additionally, an unnumbered Active Region observed towards the eastern limb in STEREO A EUVI 195 imagery (near latitude S30) may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk during the first part of the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period.  The C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-06-19T21:53Z, mentioned above, may possibly have arrived as a glancing blow at missions near Earth on 2022-06-22, as mentioned above.  Additionally, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux at GOES may possibly remain elevated during the outlook period.  Finally, there are signs in the ambient ENLIL models of a potential Solar Sector Boundary Crossing around 2022-06-22, and an equatorial coronal hole that crossed the Earth-facing central meridian on 2022-06-22 may become geoeffective around 2022-06-25.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20220622-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/20582/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-06-22T16:01Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-06-22T16:01:37Z\n## Message ID: 20220622-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2022-06-22T18:15Z and 2022-06-23T00:47Z (average arrival 2022-06-22T21:19Z) for 31% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-06-22T10:28Z and 2022-06-22T16:51Z (average arrival 2022-06-22T13:37Z) for 45% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 100% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-06-20_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA014/20220619_215300_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA014_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-06-20_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA014/20220619_215300_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA014_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-06-20_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA014/20220619_215300_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA014_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-06-20_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA014/20220619_215300_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA014_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-06-20_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA014/20220619_215300_ncmes1_sims48_LAHAINA014_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

The roughly estimated predicted range of the maximum Kp index was 6-8 (moderate to severe). Additionally, an ensemble simulation of this CME with 48 ensemble members estimated that the leading edge of the CME may impact STEREO A between about 2022-06-14T13:03Z and 2022-06-14T22:18Z (average arrival 2022-06-14T17:14Z) for 100% of simulations, STEREO B between about 2022-06-15T08:37Z and 2022-06-15T20:11Z (average arrival 2022-06-15T13:30Z) for 31% of simulations, and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-06-14T18:29Z and 2022-06-15T07:24Z (average arrival 2022-06-14T23:52Z) for 100% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicated a 86% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 6-8 range (moderate to severe) (see notification 20220614-AL-001). The arrival of this CME at STEREO A was detected by the IMPACT and PLASTIC instruments around 2022-06-14T17:44Z, while its arrival at L1, marked by a significant interplanetary shock, was detected by DSCOVR at 2022-06-15T04:01Z (see notification 20220615-AL-001). \n\nIt was also estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-06-14T01:25Z may impact Solar Orbiter (glancing blow) at 2022-06-17T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220614-AL-002).\n\nAdditionally, the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C3 at 2022-06-10T00:06Z was thoroughly analyzed to determine if the event had an Earth-directed component. Upon receiving coronagraph imagery from STEREO A COR2 previously unavailable during real-time analysis, it was later estimated that the event had a low probability for impacting NASA missions near Earth. The analysis of this event is still ongoing to confirm that the CME was not detected at L1.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic period 2022-06-13T03:00Z-06:00Z. This minor geomagnetic storm was likely caused by the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 on 2022-06-12 associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-06-12T03:37Z (see notification 20220612-AL-001). The solar wind speed reached a maximum value of approximately 566 km/s on 2022-06-13. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels through the beginning part of the reporting period until becoming slightly elevated above background levels on 2022-06-13. Both fluxes remained below their respective thresholds for the entire reporting period. The slightly elevated proton fluxes observed towards the end of the reporting period were associated with the previously mentioned M3.4 flare peaking at 2022-06-13T04:07Z and O-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-06-13T03:12Z (see notifications 20220613-AL-001, 20220613-AL-002, and 20220614-AL-001).   \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-06-10  10:11:00  11:14:00  10:54:00   M1.2   N19E90 ( 13032 ) \n2022-06-13  03:01:00  05:12:00  04:07:00   M3.4   N26E53 ( 13032 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-06-10T00:06Z     ~538            C                -2/-38               36                          SOHO, STEREO A  \n2022-06-13T03:12Z     ~1244           O                -39/-3               46                          SOHO, STEREO A \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-06-13T10:12Z     ~559            C                65/-45               35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-06-13T16:36Z     ~918            C              -122/18                13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-06-13T18:24Z     ~569            C                68/-15               27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-06-14T01:25Z     ~830            C              -174/12                56                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-06-14T05:38Z     ~516            C               -83/-2                10                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-06-14T08:12Z     ~575            C               179/34                13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-06-15T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-06-21T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently several numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13031 (S27W14) produced numerous C-class flares over the past two days and will likely remain the source of activity during the outlook period. Active Regions 13030 (N20W01) and 13032 (N21E08), which produced two M-class flares and the O-type CME during the most recent reporting period, may display some activity as well. Active Region 13036 (S12W66) is expected to rotate off the Earth-facing disk by 2022-06-18. Newly numbered Active Region 13037 (S22W25) may also display some activity before rotating off the Earth-facing disk towards the end of the outlook period on or around 2022-06-21. As seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO, an unnumbered Active Region observed towards the NE limb has begun rotating onto the Earth-facing disk (observed near N12E78). Additionally, another unnumbered Active Region observed towards the eastern limb in STEREO A EUVI 195 imagery  (at a latitude of approximately 11 degrees) may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk during the first part of the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Geomagnetic activity was recently enhanced with an observed value of  Kp = 5 during the synoptic period 2022-06-15T12:00Z-15:00Z, associated with the arrival of the previously mentioned O-type CME at L1 on 2022-06-15 (which closely followed the coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 on 2022-06-12). The arrival of these recent events may lead to an elevation in > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux at GOES during the outlook period. As seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO, there is an equatorial coronal hole structure that recently crossed the Earth-facing central meridian on 2022-06-14 and this structure could become geoeffective on or around 2022-06-17. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20220615-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/20512/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-06-15T12:30Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-06-15T12:30:47Z\n## Message ID: 20220615-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A and STEREO B. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2022-06-14T13:03Z and 2022-06-14T22:18Z (average arrival 2022-06-14T17:14Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2022-06-15T08:37Z and 2022-06-15T20:11Z (average arrival 2022-06-15T13:30Z) for 31% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-06-14T18:29Z and 2022-06-15T07:24Z (average arrival 2022-06-14T23:52Z) for 100% of simulations.

Additionally, an ensemble simulation of this CME with 32 ensemble members estimated that the leading edge of the CME may impact STEREO B between about 2022-06-05T03:34Z and 2022-06-05T16:55Z (average arrival 2022-06-05T09:15Z) for 93% of simulations, Mars between about 2022-06-06T16:54Z and 2022-06-06T19:49Z (average arrival 2022-06-06T17:59Z) for 15% of simulations, and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-06-05T14:10Z and 2022-06-06T01:31Z (average arrival 2022-06-05T19:17Z) for 71% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicated that there is a 87% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor to below minor) (see notification 20220603-AL-001). The arrival of this CME at L1 was associated with an interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE around 2022-06-06T09:20Z (see notification 20220606-AL-001).\n\nIt was also estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-06-07T04:00Z may reach Solar Orbiter at 2022-06-09T10:04Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220608-AL-002).\n\nAdditionally, it was estimated that the flank of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-06-07T21:48Z may reach STEREO A at 2022-06-11T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220608-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at low levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=3 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected at GOES remained elevated above 1000 pfu from 2022-06-01 through 2022-06-05. These elevated energetic electron flux levels are a continuation of the enhancement observed since 2022-05-30T01:35Z and are associated with a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-05-27 (see notifications 20220601-AL-001, 20220603-AL-002, and 20220605-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux levels described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-06-02T06:09Z     ~549            C                38/-8                44                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-06-02T06:48Z     ~581            C               NONE/-1(POS)          25                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-06-05T13:17Z     ~681            C               -54/-34               16                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-06-05T14:12Z     ~515            C                51/-13               26                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2022-06-07T04:00Z     ~836            C                180/21               54                          SOHO  \n2022-06-07T09:54Z     ~531            C                NONE/45(POS)         45                          SOHO                    \n2022-06-07T21:48Z     ~926            C               -37/-51               27                          SOHO, STEREO A                     \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-06-08T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-06-14T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period. Currently, there are three numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13027 (S17W88) has decayed to a plage and is expected to rotate off the Earth-facing disk by 2022-06-09. Active Regions 13028 (N14E02) and 13029 (S09E18) have also decayed to plages. Two unnumbered active regions visible towards the eastern limb in STEREO A EUVI 195 (at latitudes of +/-20 degrees) are expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk during the early part of the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between below minor and minor levels during the outlook period. There is currently a very small coronal hole close to the central meridian of the Earth-facing disk that could create some minor disturbance by 2022-06-13.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220608-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/20452/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-06-08T20:20Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-06-08T20:20:52Z\n## Message ID: 20220608-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B and Mars.

The highest values of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-05-27T12:00Z-15:00Z and 2022-05-28T00:00Z-09:00Z.  These elevated values of Kp were likely caused by the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-05-27 and associated interplanetary shock starting around 2022-05-27T09:58Z (see notification 20220527-AL-001).  The solar wind speed reached a maximum value of approximately 628 km/s on 2022-05-30.\n\nAdditionally, the STEREO A IMPACT instrument detected an interplanetary shock around 2022-05-25T02:00Z.  This arrival might have been associated with a coronal hole high speed stream from the same coronal hole that caused the above mentioned high speed stream at L1 a couple days later.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2022-05-30T01:35Z.  The elevated energetic electron flux levels were caused by the aforementioned coronal hole high speed stream at L1 starting on 2022-05-27 (see notifications 20220527-AL-001, 20220530-AL-001, 20220530-AL-002, 20220601-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor this week due to the elevated geomagnetic activity and elevated energetic electron flux levels described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-05-25  18:12:00  18:43:00  18:24:00   M1.3   S18W42 ( 13016 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-05-25T04:00Z     ~789            C               154/-33               38                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-25T05:53Z     ~696            C              -134/20                33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-25T12:00Z     ~1014           O              -120/-13               48                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-25T18:38Z     ~929            C                43/-29               34                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-05-28T15:09Z     ~821            C              -166/-25               44                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-05-30T03:12Z     ~1040           O                48/18                17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-31T08:53Z     ~808            C              -122/-29               20                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-06-01T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-06-07T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the reporting period.  There are currently seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk, three of which (Active Regions 13020, 13021, and 13022) have decayed into plages.  Active Regions 13026 (N26W32) and 13027 (S17E18) quickly developed over the last 24 hours and may show some flaring activity as they traverse the Earth-facing disk.  There is a large bright region along the SE limb of STEREO A EUVI 195 (~S20E118) that may be one or more Active Regions that could rotate onto the Earth-facing disk on or around 2022-06-04.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at low levels for the upcoming week.  Currently, there is a very diffuse coronal hole region near the center of the Earth-facing disk that may become geoeffective by 2022-06-04.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20220601-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/20394/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-06-01T12:35Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-06-01T12:35:26Z\n## Message ID: 20220601-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

GOES \"greater than 2.0 MeV\" integral electron flux remains elevated, recently crossing the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2022-06-01T03:55Z.\n\nThe elevated energetic electron flux levels observed since 2022-05-30T01:35Z (see notifications 20220530-AL-001 and 20220530-AL-002) are caused by a high speed stream which arrived on 2022-05-27, reaching a maximum speed of approximately 627 km/s. The solar wind observed at L1 is currently around 450 km/s.\n\nNASA spacecraft at GEO, MEO and other orbits passing through or in the vicinity of the Earth's outer radiation belt can be impacted.\n\nActivity ID: 2022-05-30T01:35:00-RBE-001. \n\n## Notes: \n\n\n\n"}]
