There were 4 C-type CMEs(see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic period of 2021-12-27T12:00Z-15:00Z. This elevated value of Kp may have been associated with the combined arrival of the S-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-24T17:09Z and the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-12-27 (see notification 20211227-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu beginning at 2021-12-22T15:10Z (see notifications 20211222-AL-002, 20211222-AL-003, 20211224-AL-001, 20211226-AL-001). The elevated energetic electron flux levels were associated with a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-12-19, which reached a maximum speed of approximately 688 km/s during the previous reporting period. The electron flux levels went back to nominal levels at the end of 2021-12-27.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the lengthy radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2021-12-22  06:54:00  07:21:00  07:06:00   M1.3   S21W25 (12908) \n2021-12-28  03:50:00  04:10:00  04:01:00   M1.8   N20W20 (12918) \n2021-12-28  16:00:00  16:20:00  16:11:00   M1.6   N21W21 (12918) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-12-22T13:36Z     ~569            C                44/-34               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-12-22T20:24Z     ~538            C               -14/-9                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-12-23T22:36Z     ~855            C                89/-38               12                          SOHO                              \n2021-12-24T12:24Z     ~515            C                70/-22               19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-12-29T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-01-04T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be minor to moderate throughout the outlook period. Currently, there are ten numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 12918 (N21W37) is currently at Beta-Gamma magnetic configuration, was responsible for two M-class flares on 2021-12-28, and is expected to remain active until it rotates off the Earth-facing disk by 2022-01-03.  Active Regions 12916 (S15W08), 12920 (S16W57), and 12921 (N30W64) are currently at Beta magnetic configuration but have been relatively quiet. Active Regions 12920 and 12921 should rotate off the Earth-facing disk by 2022-01-01.  Active Regions 12917 (S28W48) and 12919 (S11E26) are currently at Alpha magnetic configuration and are expected to remain quiet during the outlook period.  Active Regions 12912 (S13W55), 12913 (S25W79), 12914 (S17W75), and 12915 (N16W58) have decayed to plages.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be minor to moderate during the outlook period due to the previously mentioned arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2021-12-27. The solar wind speeds have reached a peak value around 540 km/s. A small coronal hole structure centered near N08W02 may become geoeffective towards the end of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20211227-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/18662/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-12-27T13:34Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-12-27T13:34:32Z\n## Message ID: 20211227-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate to high levels during this reporting period with 4 M-class flares and 4 C-type CMEs (see details below). \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the leading edge of the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-15T05:00Z may arrive at STEREO A at 2021-12-17T22:17Z and arrive as a glancing blow at Solar Orbiter at 2021-12-18T06:00Z and NASA missions near Earth at 2021-12-18T09:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20211215-AL-002). Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model run with 48 ensemble members predicted that the leading edge of this C-type CME will reach STEREO A between about 2021-12-17T19:34Z and 2021-12-18T13:42Z (average arrival 2021-12-18T04:14Z) for 100% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-12-17T21:54Z and 2021-12-18T06:28Z (average arrival 2021-12-18T01:47Z) for 16% of simulations (see notification 20211216-AL-001).\n\nIt was also estimated that the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-18T18:12Z may arrive as a glancing blow to Parker Solar Probe at 2021-12-21T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) and STEREO A at 2021-12-22T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20211219-AL-002).\n\nTowards the end of the reporting period, the leading edge of an S-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-20T05:48Z, a C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-20T12:36Z, and an S-type CME observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-20T15:38Z was estimated to arrive at Solar Orbiter at 2021-12-23T20:00Z (minor impact), STEREO A at 2021-12-24T03:03Z, and NASA missions near Earth at 2021-12-23T15:46Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20211222-AL-001). Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model run for two of these three CMEs observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-20T05:48Z and 2021-12-20T12:36Z each with 24 ensemble members predicted that the leading edge of the CMEs will reach STEREO A between about 2021-12-23T17:36Z and 2021-12-24T05:27Z (average arrival 2021-12-24T00:12Z) for 95% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-12-23T11:23Z and 2021-12-23T23:26Z (average arrival 2021-12-23T16:28Z) for 79% of simulations (see notification 20211221-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2021-12-19T21:00Z-2021-12-20T00:00Z. This elevated value of Kp may have been associated with the combined arrival of the S-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-14T17:38Z and the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-15T05:00Z mentioned above as well as the subsequent arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-12-19 (see notification 20211219-AL-001). Strong compression of the magnetosphere was detected following this arrival. Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2021-12-19T18:59Z (see notifications 20211219-AL-003 and 20211219-AL-004).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. However, energetic electron flux levels were elevated above background levels towards the end of the reporting period. This increase is associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-12-19. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2021-12-17  00:51:00  00:56:00  00:39:00   M1.2   N19E70 ( 12911 ) \n2021-12-20  11:12:00  11:55:00  11:36:00   M1.8   S20W01 ( 12908 ) \n2021-12-21  07:43:00  07:57:00  07:50:00   M1.1   S17E89 ( 12916 ) \n2021-12-21  11:31:00  11:49:00  11:44:00   M1.4   S17E89 ( 12916 )  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-12-15T05:00Z     ~680            C               -42/2                 24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-12-20T12:36Z     ~546            C                -7/-13               35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-12-15T09:48Z     ~528            C               -44/-14               10                          SOHO                              \n2021-12-18T18:12Z     ~650            C               -90/-6                35                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-12-22T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-12-28T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary from minor to moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are several numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing solar disk. Active Regions 12907, 12908, and 12909 have been the source of recent C-class flaring and one M-class flare. Active Region 12916, which recently rotated onto the Earth-facing disk, produced 2 M-class flares and continues to be a candidate for additional flaring activity. As seen in the EUV imagery from STEREO A, three unnumbered active regions observed towards the eastern limb of the STEREO-A-facing disk are likely to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period due to the predicted combined arrival at L1 on 2021-12-23 of the S-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-20T05:48Z, the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-20T12:36Z, and the S-type CME observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-20T15:38Z. Additionally, the southward extension of a northern polar coronal hole currently visible near N25E20 as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA may become geoeffective on or around 2021-12-27. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2021-12-22T15:10Z and is expected to remain elevated throughout the beginning of the outlook period (see notification 20211222-AL-003). These elevated energetic electron flux levels are associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-12-19.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20211222-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/18621/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-12-22T15:39Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-12-22T15:39:16Z\n## Message ID: 20211222-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME with ID 2021-12-15T05:00:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20211215-AL-002). Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2021-12-17T19:34Z and 2021-12-18T13:42Z (average arrival 2021-12-18T04:14Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-12-17T21:54Z and 2021-12-18T06:28Z (average arrival 2021-12-18T01:47Z) for 16% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 62% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor to below minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-12-15_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105/20211215_050000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-12-15_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105/20211215_050000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-12-15_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105/20211215_050000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-12-15_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105/20211215_050000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-12-15_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105/20211215_050000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-12-15_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105/20211215_050000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThe initial non-ensemble simulation of this CME also predicted a glancing blow at Solar Orbiter (see previous notification 20211215-AL-002).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-12-15_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105/Detailed_results_20211215_050000_ncmes1_sims48_HILOX105.txt\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"Report","messageID":"20211215-7D-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/18546/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-12-15T21:05Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (CCMC DONKI)\n## Message Type: Weekly Space Weather Summary Report for December 08, 2021 - December 14, 2021\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-12-15T21:05:27Z\n## Report Coverage Begin Date: 2021-12-08T00:00Z\n## Report Coverage End Date: 2021-12-14T23:59Z\n## Message ID: 20211215-7D-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were no significant flares and only 3 C-type CMEs (see details below).\n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the flank of the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-09T05:00Z may arrive as a glancing blow to Parker Solar Probe at 2021-12-10T18:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20211209-AL-002). It was also estimated that a C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-09T23:24Z would potentially arrive at Parker Solar Probe at 2021-12-11T12:53Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20211210-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at low levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 3 for the reporting period.\n\nDSCOVR and ACE detected an interplanetary shock at L1 at 2021-12-10T13:27Z. The arrival signature may be associated with the combined arrival of two S-type CMEs first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-12-05T14:36Z and 2012-12-06T05:48Z. Additionally, STEREO A detected an interplanetary shock at 2021-12-10T11:00Z possibly due to a coronal hole high speed stream arrival.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu beginning at 2021-12-09T12:40Z (see notification 20211209-AL-001). The elevated energetic electron flux levels were associated with a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-12-03, which reached a maximum speed of approximately 534 km/s during the previous reporting period. The electron flux levels went back to nominal levels on 2021-12-11. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-12-09T05:00Z     ~630            C              -105/14                11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2021-12-09T23:24Z     ~697            C              -121/-6                16                          SOHO                              \n2021-12-13T11:48Z     ~557            C               -90/-9                15                          SOHO                              \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-12-15T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-12-21T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be minor to moderate throughout the outlook period due to increased activity from the newest Active Regions rotating onto the Earth-facing disk. Currently, there are six numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 12904 (S26W87) has decayed into a plage and will rotate off of the Earth-facing disk around 2021-12-16. Active Regions 12905 (S11E05), 12906 (S29E13), and 12907 (S21E38) produced multiple flares as they rotated onto the Earth-facing disk, with Active Region 12907 producing the most C-class flares in the past few days. These Active Regions will likely continue to have flaring activity throughout the outlook period. Active Regions 12908 (S21E55) and 12909 (S21E75) were numbered today and may show flaring activity throughout the outlook period. There are multiple unnumbered Active Regions, one currently on the Earth-facing disk near N25E03 that may produce some minor flaring activity, and at least three potential Active Regions on the Eastern limb of STEREO A EUV imagery that may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by the end of 2021-12-18.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be minor to moderate during the outlook period due to the current arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2021-12-15. The solar wind speeds have reached a peak value around 567 km/s. There is an associated interplanetary shock with this arrival signature at L1 (see notification 20211215-AL-001). A small coronal hole structure centered near S25E10 may become geoeffective towards the end of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20211215-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/18538/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-12-15T20:23Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (STEREO A, Solar Orbiter, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-12-15T20:23:45Z\n## Message ID: 20211215-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2021-12-01T00:00Z-06:00Z and 2021-12-01T21:00Z to 2021-12-02T00:00Z. These elevated values of Kp may have been associated with the arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-11-30.

Currently, there are three numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 12901 (N21W61) and 12903 (S18W52) have decayed to plages and should rotate off the Earth-facing disk by 2021-12-11.  Active Region 12904 (S26E16) has decayed to alpha magnetic configuration, nearly to a plage, and should remain quiet throughout the outlook period. One unnumbered active region currently visible on the eastern limb in STEREO A EUV imagery, near latitude S20, may start rotating onto the Earth-facing disk by 2021-12-11.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor levels during the outlook period. A small coronal hole near latitude N25 that crossed the central meridian of the Earth-facing disk on 2021-12-05 may possibly become geoeffective early in the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20211208-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/18486/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-12-08T16:53Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-12-08T16:53:48Z\n## Message ID: 20211208-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were 4 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2021-11-24T14:09Z may affect Solar Orbiter at 2021-11-27T13:45Z, NASA missions near Earth at 2021-11-27T13:24Z, and arrive as a glancing blow to STEREO A at 2021-11-28T01:00Z and STEREO B 2021-11-27T14:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20211124-AL-001).  Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model run for this CME with 48 ensemble members predicted that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO A between about 2021-11-27T12:08Z and 2021-11-28T01:07Z (average arrival 2021-11-27T18:32Z) for 52% of simulations, STEREO B between about 2021-11-27T05:48Z and 2021-11-27T11:38Z (average arrival 2021-11-27T08:36Z) for 20% of simulations, and NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-11-27T05:00Z and 2021-11-27T22:14Z (average arrival 2021-11-27T13:25Z) for 100% of simulations (see notification 20211125-AL-001). The arrival of this CME was associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2021-11-27T21:50Z. It was also detected by the IMPACT instrument at STEREO A around 2021-11-28T17:14Z.\n\nFor the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-11-26T00:36Z, it was estimated may arrive as a glancing blow at Mars at 2021-11-30T08:00Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2021-11-29T11:00Z, and Solar Orbiter at 2021-11-29T18:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). For the C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-11-26T01:25Z, it was estimated that may impact STEREO A at 2021-11-29T01:11Z and arrive as a glancing blow to NASA missions near Earth at 2021-11-29T11:00Z and Solar Orbiter at 2021-11-29T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20211126-AL-001).  Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model run for this CME with 48 ensemble members predicted that the leading edge of this CME will reach STEREO A between about 2021-11-28T17:49Z and 2021-11-29T10:24Z (average arrival 2021-11-29T03:42Z) for 77% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-11-29T03:54Z and 2021-11-29T08:34Z (average arrival 2021-11-29T06:14Z) for 4% of simulations (see notification 20211126-AL-002). The arrival of this CME was associated with the arrival detected by the IMPACT instrument at STEREO A around 2021-11-29T02:45Z. Lastly, the C-type CME initially observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2021-11-29T10:38Z is estimated to arrive at Solar Orbiter at 2021-12-02T12:12Z and NASA missions near Earth at 2021-12-02T10:55Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20211129-AL-001).  Additionally, a heliospheric ensemble model run for this CME with 48 ensemble members predicted that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO B between about 2021-12-02T09:30Z and 2021-12-02T20:42Z (average arrival 2021-12-02T16:22Z) for 43% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-12-02T02:40Z and 2021-12-02T12:58Z (average arrival 2021-12-02T08:24Z) for 100% of simulations (see notification 20211130-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2021-11-30T21:00Z to 2021-12-01T00:00Z. This elevated value of Kp may have been associated with the arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-11-30. The solar wind speeds reached values around 570 km/s on 2021-12-01.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES exceeded the threshold level of 1000 pfu at 2021-11-24T13:10Z and 2021-11-26T12:35Z (see notification 20211125-AL-002). This was a continuation of a radiation belt enhancement that began on 2021-11-23 during the previous reporting period, and was caused by a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-11-20 (see notifications 20211123-AL-001 and 20211123-AL-002).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due the CME arrivals at STEREO A and at L1 and the radiation belt enhancement in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-11-24T14:09Z     ~561            C                -3/-16               31                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2021-11-26T01:25Z     ~539            C               -39/18                29                          SOHO                              \n2021-11-29T10:38Z     ~600            C                -5/-19               27                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-11-26T00:36Z     ~518            C               179/-6                29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-12-01T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-12-07T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to minor for the upcoming week. Currently, there are five numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Two Active Regions, 12898 (S25W52) and 12900 (S27W64), should rotate off the Earth-facing disk by 2021-12-04.  Two other Active Regions, 12901 (N15E37) and 12903 (S17E41), have decayed to plages and should remain quiet throughout the outlook period. Active Region 12902 (N18W06) may potentially become active during the outlook period. Two unnumbered active regions currently visible on the eastern limb in STEREO A EUV imagery, one near latitude S20 and one near latitude N25, may start rotating onto the Earth-facing disk by 2021-12-04.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor to moderate levels during the outlook period due to the arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream at L1 on 2021-11-30. The solar wind speeds reached peak values around 570 km/s on 2021-12-01. A large equatorial coronal hole structure that crossed the Earth-facing meridian on 2021-11-30 may possibly become geoeffective near the middle of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"}]
