For 48 ensemble members, simulations indicate that the combined leading edge of the CMEs will reach STEREO A between about 2021-05-25T17:15Z and 2021-05-25T23:05Z (average arrival 2021-05-25T20:22Z) for 31% of simulations, STEREO B between about 2021-05-25T20:48Z and 2021-05-26T05:44Z (average arrival 2021-05-26T01:51Z) for 97% of simulations, and NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-05-25T09:19Z and 2021-05-25T22:21Z (average arrival 2021-05-25T14:04Z) for 97% of simulations (see notifications 20210522-AL-003, 20210523-AL-001 and 20210525-AL-001).  Additionally, this combined leading edge was predicted to arrive at Parker Solar Probe as a glancing blow at 2021-05-24T20:00Z (see notification 20210523-AL-001).\n\nIt was also estimated that the combined leading edge of three C-type CMEs (first visible in coronagraphs images at 2021-05-23T09:53Z, 2021-05-23T11:38Z, and 2021-05-23T17:38Z) may impact STEREO B and NASA missions near Earth. For 48 ensemble members, simulations indicate that the combined leading edge of the CMEs will reach STEREO B between about 2021-05-26T07:56Z and 2021-05-26T17:10Z (average arrival 2021-05-26T12:21Z) for 100% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-05-26T09:25Z and 2021-05-26T17:16Z (average arrival 2021-05-26T12:30Z) for 54% of simulations (see notifications 20210523-AL-002, 20210524-AL-002 and 20210525-AL-002).  Additionally, this combined leading edge was predicted to arrive at Parker Solar Probe at 2021-05-25T04:52Z (see notifications 20210523-AL-002 and 20210524-AL-002). \n\nOn 2021-05-26T11:37Z, an arrival was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 that may be associated to a combination of all these CMEs described above. Analysis of this arrival is still ongoing (see notification 20210526-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic period 2021-05-20T12:00Z-15:00Z. This elevated value of Kp was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-05-20 (see notification 20210520-AL-001). Solar wind speeds from this event reached values around 590 km/s on 2021-05-21 and decreased to around 310 km/s by the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was elevated above the threshold level of 1000 pfu throughout the last half of the reporting period beginning on 2021-05-22 (see notifications 20210522-AL-001, 20210522-AL-002 and 20210524-AL-001). These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt were associated with the the coronal hole high speed stream mentioned above detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-05-20.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the solar activity and the elevated energetic electron fluxes on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2021-05-22   17:03:00  17:16:00  17:11:00  M1.1    N20E18 (Active Region 12824)\n2021-05-22   21:30:00  21:43:00  21:36:00  M1.4    N20E15 (Active Region 12824)\n2021-05-23   11:00:00  11:14:00  11:08:00  M1.1    N21E07 (Active Region 12824)\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-05-22T09:12Z      500            C              -20/-3                 21                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2021-05-22T16:09Z      611            C              -17/15                 20                          STEREO A\n2021-05-22T22:09Z      670            C               25/13                 26                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2021-05-23T09:53Z      699            C               22/5                  26                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2021-05-23T11:38Z      806            C               25/8                  31                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2021-05-23T17:38Z      703            C               27/1                  23                          SOHO, STEREO A\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-05-24T01:25Z      585            C               35/6                  11                          SOHO\n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-05-26T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-06-01T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period. Active Region 12824 produced multiple C-class flares and three M-class flares near the middle of the reporting period and may continue to produce C-class flares during the early part of the outlook period until it rotates off the Earth-facing disk.  Active Region 12825 has been relatively quiet and has produced only B-class flares. This activity is expected to continue during the outlook period as it transits the Earth-facing disk.  There is also an additional unnumbered Active Region visible just over the eastern limb in the SDO field of view and at the east of STEREO A EUVI imagery.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period, due to the recent arrival at L1 of the 2021-05-22 and/or 2021-05-23 CMEs on 2021-05-26. A small coronal hole centered near S20E35 at the end of the reporting period may possibly affect STEREO-A early in the outlook period and may potentially become geoeffective late in the outlook period. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20210526-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/16993/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-05-26T18:05Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-05-26T18:05:23Z\n## Message ID: 20210526-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CMEs may impact STEREO A and STEREO B. For 48 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edges of the CMEs will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2021-05-25T17:15Z and 2021-05-25T23:05Z (average arrival 2021-05-25T20:22Z) for 31% of simulations.\n- STEREO B between about 2021-05-25T20:48Z and 2021-05-26T05:44Z (average arrival 2021-05-26T01:51Z) for 97% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CMEs are estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2021-05-25T09:19Z and 2021-05-25T22:21Z (average arrival 2021-05-25T14:04Z) for 97% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 88% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-05-24_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080/20210522_091200_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-05-24_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080/20210522_091200_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-05-24_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080/20210522_091200_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-05-24_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080/20210522_091200_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-05-24_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080/20210522_091200_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-05-24_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080/20210522_091200_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080_STA_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-05-24_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080/20210522_091200_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-05-24_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080/20210522_091200_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2021-05-24_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080/Detailed_results_20210522_091200_ncmes3_sims48_HILOX080.txt\n###\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20210524-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/16981/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-05-24T20:17Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs update (Parker Solar Probe, STEREO B, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-05-24T20:17:28Z\n## Message ID: 20210524-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Two of the three numbered Active Regions currently visible on the Earth-facing disk will be rotating off the disk in the first few days of the outlook period.  Active Region 12824 produced multiple B-class flares and one C-class flare near the end of the reporting period and may continue to produce B-class flares during the outlook period. An unnumbered Active Region visible on the eastern limb in the STEREO A field of view at the end of the reporting period may rotate onto the STEREO A-facing disk early in the outlook period and onto the Earth-facing disk late in the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. The equatorial coronal hole structure crossing the center of the Earth-facing disk on 2021-05-15 may become geoeffective in the beginning of the outlook period. \n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score8\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"Report","messageID":"20210512-7D-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/16896/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-05-12T21:15Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (CCMC DONKI)\n## Message Type: Weekly Space Weather Summary Report for May 05, 2021 - May 11, 2021\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-05-12T21:15:16Z\n## Report Coverage Begin Date: 2021-05-05T00:00Z\n## Report Coverage End Date: 2021-05-11T23:59Z\n## Message ID: 20210512-7D-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The M3.9 flare originated from the active region 12822 located at N17E78 and peaked at 2021-05-07T19:04Z. The flare was associated with a C-type CME starting on 2021-05-07T19:53Z. Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that this CME may impact Mars at 2021-05-12T13:50Z, Solar Orbiter at 2021-05-10T06:43Z, and STEREO-A at 2021-05-10T04:07Z (plus/minus 7 hours)(see notifications 20210507-AL-001 and 20210508-AL-001). The arrival of this CME was detected at STEREO-A on 2021-05-10T21:30Z. The second C-type CME that started on 2021-05-09T11:23Z was predicted to impact missions near Earth at 2021-05-12T03:34Z (plus/minus 7 hours)(see notification 20210509-AL-001). The third C-type CME (simulated together with the 2021-05-09T11:23Z CME) started on 2021-05-09T15:23Z and was associated with a C4.0 flare from active region 12822 that peaked at 2021-05-09T13:58Z. This CME was estimated to impact Solar Orbiter at 2021-05-12T08:08Z and STEREO-A at 2021-05-12T08:55Z, with a potential glancing blow at Mars at 2021-05-14T14:00Z (plus/minus 7 hours)(see notification 20210509-AL-001). An ensemble simulation with these two CMEs predicted an impact to STEREO A between about 2021-05-12T04:13Z and 2021-05-12T08:34Z (average arrival 2021-05-12T06:15Z) for 100% of simulations and missions near Earth between about 2021-05-11T22:27Z and 2021-05-12T11:26Z (average arrival 2021-05-12T04:44Z) for 100% of simulations (see notification 20210511-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=2 for the current reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low during the reporting period.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2021-05-07  18:43:00  19:19:00  19:04:00   M3.9   N17E78 (12822)          \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-05-09T11:23Z     ~717            C               -10/-4                27                          STEREO A                          \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-05-07T19:53Z     ~815            C               -78/5                 40                          STEREO A, SOHO    \n2021-05-09T15:23Z     ~580            C               -60/12                45                          STEREO A                                          \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-05-12T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-05-18T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low to moderate levels for the outlook period.

Geomagnetic conditions have reached a strong geomagnetic storm with Kp=7 during the synoptic periods of 2021-05-12T12:00Z-18:00Z (see notifications 20210512-AL-002 and 20210512-AL-003). This enhancement is due to the arrival of the 2021-05-09T11:23Z C-type CME detected at L1 on 2021-05-12T05:48Z (see notification 20210512-AL-001). Simulations also indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit at 2021-05-12T12:47Z due to this arrival (see notification 20210512-AL-004).\n\nIn the later part of the outlook period there might be an arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream from a northern extension of the southern pole coronal hole which rotated onto the solar disk around 2021-05-09.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"MPC","messageID":"20210512-AL-004","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/16895/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-05-12T17:26Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Magnetopause Crossing\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-05-12T17:26:07Z\n## Message ID: 20210512-AL-004\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There was one C-type CME (see details below). Based on preliminary analysis of the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that this C-type CME, first observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2021-05-02T12:23Z, may impact Solar Orbiter at 2021-05-05T12:21Z and Mars (glancing blow) at 2021-05-08T12:00Z (plus or minus 7 hours).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at low levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=3 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was elevated above the threshold level of 1000 pfu during the first part of the reporting period (see notifications 20210428-AL-001, 20210428-AL-002, and 20210430-AL-001). These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 on 2021-04-23. Solar wind speeds associated with this high speed stream reached values around 550 km/s during the previous reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to elevated energetic electron fluxes on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-05-02T12:23Z     ~512            C              -114/-1                26                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-05-05T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-05-11T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. One unnumbered active region has rotated onto the Earth-facing disk within the past few days as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO. Another unnumbered active region currently visible towards the NE limb of the STEREO-A-facing disk will be rotating onto the Earth-facing disk soon and shows potential for increased flaring or CMEs during the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A northern extension of the south polar coronal hole crossing the center of the Earth-facing disk on 2021-05-05 may become geoeffective towards the end of the outlook period as early as 2021-05-11. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"}]
