The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2018-02-23T09:00Z-12:00Z and 2018-02-27T03:00Z-06:00Z. These slight increases in geomagnetic activity were associated with the arrival of coronal hole high speed streams detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-02-22 and 2018-02-26, respectively. Solar wind speed reached values of ~550 km/s on 2018-02-23 and 2018-02-27.\n\nSTEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a couple coronal hole high speed streams around 2018-02-21 and 2018-02-26, respectively.  Solar wind speed reached values of >650 km/s on 2018-02-22 and 2018-02-27.\n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the reporting period, but it was elevated around 2018-02-21.  This increase in the electron flux on the Earth's outer radiation belt was possibly associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2018-02-16.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2018-02-28T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2018-03-06T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week. There are currently two active regions visible at the surface of the sun that could produce some flare or CME activity. An increase in geomagnetic activity is possible in the next few days due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream originating from the northern coronal hole seen in SDO images close to disk center around 2018-02-28.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

ENSEMBLE PRODUCT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT MODE. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME(s) with ID(s) 2018-02-12T01:25:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20180212-AL-001). Based on heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth. Out of 32 ensemble members (see notes section), 26 (81%) indicate impact at NASA missions near Earth. Ensemble simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2018-02-14T12:00Z and 2018-02-15T12:38Z (average arrival 2018-02-15T02:16Z). The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 82% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 2-4 range (below minor to below minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2018-02-12_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX067/20180212_012500_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX067_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2018-02-12_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX067/20180212_012500_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX067_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2018-02-12_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX067/20180212_012500_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX067_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2018-02-12_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX067/20180212_012500_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX067_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at SWRC is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2018-02-12_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX067/Detailed_results_20180212_012500_ncmes1_sims32_HILOX067.txt\n###\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
