There were no significant flares or CMEs.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=3 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-05-06T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-05-12T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.  There are no significant active regions present on the solar surface as visible on the available imagery.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week due to the possible arrival of a coronal high speed stream around 2020-05-10. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
