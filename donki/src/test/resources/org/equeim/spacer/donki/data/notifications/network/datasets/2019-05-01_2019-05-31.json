This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate levels during this reporting period.  There were 3 C-type CMEs (see details below).   Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the CME starting on 2019-05-08T04:00Z may impact STEREO A at 2019-05-10T14:04Z and OSIRIS-REx (glancing blow) at 2019-05-11T16:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20190508-AL-001).   STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the CME arrival around 2019-05-10T07:00Z.  \n\nSimulations also indicated that the leading edge of 2 S-types (<500 km/s) CMEs that started on 2019-05-10T19:09Z and 2019-05-11T02:39Z, would reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2019-05-14T23:50Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20190511-AL-001).  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at strong levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=7 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=7 occurred during the synoptic period of 2019-05-14T06:00Z-09:00Z (see notifications 20190514-AL-001, 20190514-AL-002, and 20190514-AL-003).  This strong geomagnetic storm could be associated with the arrival detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2019-05-13T22:06Z of the 2 S-type CMEs described above or another transient that was not visible on the available imagery.  \n\nThere was another CME arrival detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2019-05-10T16:55Z.  This disturbance could be associated with the arrival of the S-type CME that started on 2019-05-07T04:42Z.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2019-05-11T20:20Z. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated to the CME arrival detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 on 2019-05-10T16:55Z described above (see notifications 20190511-AL-002 and 20190511-AL-003).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the CME activity and the elevated energetic electrons fluxes on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2019-05-12T19:54Z     ~528            C               -15/-15               26                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2019-05-13T16:09Z     ~594            C                10/-13               27                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2019-05-08T04:00Z     ~790            C               -75/-12               32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2019-05-15T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2019-05-21T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming period.

There were 2 C-type CMEs (see details below). Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the CMEs starting on 2019-05-03T18:36Z and 2019-05-03T23:36Z may impact Spitzer at 2019-05-06T09:29Z, STEREO A at 2019-05-07T04:46Z, Mars at 2019-05-08T15:30Z (plus minus 7 hours) and have a glancing blow to OSIRIS-REx at around 2019-05-07T10:00Z (see notification 20190504-AL-001). STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the CME arrival around 2019-05-06T22:20Z.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2019-05-01T21:00Z to 2019-05-02T06:00Z. This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2019-05-01. The solar wind speed reached values of ~560 km/s on 2019-05-02.\n\nThe >0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2019-05-03T17:25Z. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES are associated with the coronal hole high speed stream on 2019-05-01 described above (see notifications 20190503-AL-001 and 20190503-AL-002).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2019-05-03T18:36Z     ~863            C              -129/-12               25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2019-05-03T23:36Z     ~776            C               -75/12                31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2019-05-08T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2019-05-14T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.
