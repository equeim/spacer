The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2021-03-25T00:00Z-03:00Z. This enhanced geomagnetic activity is associated with a S-type (<500 km/s) CME arrival. The CME was first visible in the coronagraph imagery on 2021-03-20T00:48Z and was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2021-03-24T19:18Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was elevated above the threshold level of 1000 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period (see notification 20210325-AL-001). These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the arrival of the S-type CME mentioned above. A weaker transient signature was also detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2021-03-24T04:57Z that may have contributed to the increase in the energetic electron flux.  The electron fluxes went back to nominal levels around 2021-03-27.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the significantly elevated electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-03-31T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-04-06T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period.

Active regions 12811 and 12812 produced multiple A and B-class flares which may continue throughout the early portion of the next reporting period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the next outlook period due to the possible arrival of high speed streams from a cluster of coronal holes centered around the Earth-facing disk's meridian on 2021-03-30.

The cause of this enhanced geomagnetic activity is associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-03-19, with solar wind speeds reaching values around 680 km/s on 2021-03-21.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was elevated above the threshold level of 1000 pfu throughout most of the reporting period (see notifications 20210318-AL-001, 20210321-AL-001 and 20210323-AL-001). These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the coronal hole high speed streams detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-03-13 and 2021-03-19, respectively.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement mentioned above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-03-24T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-03-30T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. New Active Regions 2811 and 2812 rotated onto the Earth-facing disk near the end of the reporting period. There is one new active region due to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk early in the outlook period, as seen in STEREO-A EUVI imagery near S30E95 at the end of the reporting period. Active Region 2811 produced several B-class flares near the end of the reporting period and may continue to produce several B-class flares during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity may vary between low and minor levels throughout the outlook period due to the possible influence of a coronal hole structure connected with the south pole coronal hole, which passed the Earth-facing meridian near the end of the reporting period.  This coronal hole structure may have affected STEREO A near the end of the reporting period, and may possibly become geoeffective near the middle of the outlook period. Electron flux levels may continue to remain elevated during the early part of the outlook period due to the coronal hole high speed stream described above detected at L1  on 2021-03-19.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20210323-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/16649/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-03-23T12:26Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-03-23T12:26:11Z\n## Message ID: 20210323-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were no significant flares or CMEs.\n\nGeomagnetic activity reached minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods 2021-03-03T00:00Z-09:00Z. The cause of this enhanced geomagnetic activity is associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 on 2021-03-02, with solar wind speeds reaching values around 690 km/s on 2021-03-03.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was elevated above the threshold level of 1000 pfu throughout most of the reporting period (see notifications 20210303-AL-001, 20210303-AL-002, 20210305-AL-001, 20210307-AL-001, and 20210309-AL-001). These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 on 2021-03-02 and may have been enhanced by the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 on 2021-03-05, with solar wind speeds reaching values around 600 km/s on 2021-03-06.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement mentioned above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-03-10T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-03-16T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. New Active Region 2808 developed on the Earth-facing disk near the end of the reporting period. There is one new active region due to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk in the next several days, as seen near latitude N20 on the eastern limb in STEREO-A EUVI imagery towards the end of the reporting period. Active Region 2808 produced one C-class flare and several B-class flares near the end of the reporting period and may produce several B-class flares, with the minor possibility for C-class flares, during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity may vary between low and minor levels throughout the outlook period due to the possible influence of a coronal hole structure, which passed the Earth-facing meridian near the end of the reporting period. As seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO, this coronal hole structure is connected with the south pole coronal hole and may become geoeffective near the middle of the outlook period. In response to 2021-03-02 and 2021-03-05 high speed stream arrivals at L1, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt remains elevated above the threshold level of 1000 pfu and may continue to be elevated during the early part of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20210309-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/16587/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-03-09T15:21Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-03-09T15:21:18Z\n## Message ID: 20210309-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
