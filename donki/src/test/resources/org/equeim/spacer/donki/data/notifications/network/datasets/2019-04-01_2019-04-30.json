There was 1 C-type CME (see details below). Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that this CME (starting at 2019-04-03T04:09Z) may impact Spitzer at around 2019-04-05T22:20Z (plus minus 7 hours) and may have a flank impact at STEREO A at around 2019-04-06T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20190404-AL-001). This CME arrival was possibly detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments at around 2019-04-05T11:00Z.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2019-04-03T03:00Z-06:00Z, 2019-04-08T03:00Z-06:00Z and 2019-04-09T00:00Z-03:00Z. These slight increases in geomagnetic activity were associated with the arrival of two small coronal hole high speed streams detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2019-04-04 and 2019-04-08, respectively. The solar wind speed reached values of ~530 km/s on 2019-04-05 and ~480 km/s on 2019-05-08.\n\nThe >0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2019-04-05T15:30Z. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES are associated with the coronal hole high speed stream on 2019-04-04 described above (see notifications 20190405-AL-002 and 20190407-AL-001).\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2019-04-03T04:09Z     ~506            C              -124/3                 22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2019-04-10T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2019-04-16T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.

There were no significant flares or CMEs.  \n   \nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.

This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a weak coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2019-03-31. The solar wind speed reached values of ~400 km/s on 2019-03-31 and 2019-04-01.\n\nThe STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2019-03-28.  Solar wind speed reached values of ~550km/s on 2019-03-30.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed   \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2019-04-03T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2019-04-09T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.
