There were two non-Earth directed CMEs, one O-type CME and another narrow C-type CME (see details below). Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the O-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-06-28T20:00Z may impact OSIRIS-REx at 2021-07-01T04:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20210629-AL-001). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=3 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was briefly elevated above the threshold level of 1000 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period on 2021-06-24 (see notifications 20210624-AL-001 and 20210624-AL-002). These significantly elevated electron flux levels were associated with a brief increase in the solar wind speed and magnetic field strength detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-06-22 caused possibly by a current sheet interaction and a small transient.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to elevated energetic electron fluxes on the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-06-28T20:00Z     ~1181           O               131/18                38                          SOHO, STEREO A   \n2021-06-28T20:00Z     ~530(POS)       C               lat=3(POS)            10                          SOHO                   \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-06-30T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-07-06T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Currently, there are three numbered active regions (12835, 12836, 12837) visible in the available EUV imagery from SDO and STEREO A, as well as two unnumbered active regions. Out of these active regions, active region 12835 currently displays the greatest magnetic complexity and potential for producing flares and CMEs. It produced several C-class flares in the past three days. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A southern extension of the northern polar coronal hole crossing the center of the Earth-facing disk on 2021-06-27 seems to have become geoeffective on 2021-06-30. A small equatorial coronal hole near the center of the disk might be expected to become geoeffective by 2021-07-05.\n\nalso \n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20210629-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/17171/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-06-29T18:21Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-REx)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-06-29T18:21:07Z\n## Message ID: 20210629-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Two unnumbered active regions observed near S20E10 and S25W15 as seen on the SDO imagery at the end of the reporting period may possibly generate some activity during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period.  The arrival at L1 on 2021-06-15 of the high speed stream from a northern extension of the south polar coronal hole near S15W40 at the end of the reporting period may possibly generate some minor geomagnetic disturbance followed by a possible radiation belt enhancement early in the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES is currently elevated above background levels between 500 and 800 pfu, but has not yet crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20210615-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/17083/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-06-15T12:49Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-06-15T12:49:27Z\n## Message ID: 20210615-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low to moderate levels during this reporting period.  There was one C-type CME (see details below).  Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that this CME may affect Parker Solar Probe and STEREO B. The leading edge of the CME was estimated to reach Parker Solar Probe at 2021-05-30T15:00Z and STEREO B at 2021-05-31T18:46Z (plus minus 7 hours). The simulation also indicated that the CME may have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth at about 2021-06-01T06:00Z (plus minus 7 hours).  The roughly estimated range of the maximum Kp index is 2-3 (below minor) (see notification 20210529-AL-003). The arrival of this CME may have been detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2021-06-02T12:20Z. Analysis of this event is still ongoing. \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic period 2021-05-26T18:00Z-21:00Z. This elevated value of Kp was associated with the combined arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-05-26 and 2021-05-27 of several CMEs that started on 2021-05-22 and 2021-05-23, respectively (see notification 20210526-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was above the threshold level of 1000 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period due to the continuing effects of the high speed stream starting on 2021-05-20 (see notifications 20210522-AL-001, 20210522-AL-002, 20210524-AL-001, and 20210526-AL-002). The fluxes went back to nominal levels on 2021-05-27.  \n\nSolar energetic particle event was detected by GOES. The flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2021-05-29T03:00Z (see notifications 20210529-AL-001 and 20210529-AL-002). This solar energetic particle event was due to a long duration C9.4 flare from Active Region 12824 that peaked on 2021-05-28T22:19Z and the associated C-type CME described below (see notification 20210529-AL-003).  The energetic proton flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A also became slightly elevated, but remained below the threshold of 0.1 pfu/MeV. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the combined CME arrivals at L1 detected by DSCOVR and ACE and the solar energetic particle event mentioned above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-05-28T23:12Z     ~824            C                62/-9                46                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-06-02T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-06-08T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Active Regions 12826, 12827, 12828, and 12829 were numbered during the previous outlook period. Active Regions 12827, 12828, and 12829 have produced multiple B-class flares and this activity is expected to continue during the outlook period as they continue to cross the Earth-facing disk.  An unnumbered Active Region currently rotating onto the STEREO A facing disk may cross onto the Earth-facing disk by the end of the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period due to the possible arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-06-02 of the CME that started on 2021-05-28 mentioned above. Two small coronal hole structures are visible on the Earth and STEREO A facing disks.  The first is centered near N05W30 and may become geoeffective in the early portion of the outlook period. The second coronal hole is centered near S20E30 and may impact STEREO A towards the first half of the reporting period.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"}]
