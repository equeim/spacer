This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at low levels during this reporting period.  There were no significant flares or CMEs.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=6 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=6 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2019-08-31T12:00Z-15:00Z and 2019-09-01T12:00Z-15:00Z.  This geomagnetic storm was caused by the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 around 2019-08-30 (see notifications 20190831-AL-001, 20190831-AL-002, and 20190901-AL-001).  This strong coronal hole high speed stream disturbance lasted for several days and the solar wind speed reached values of ~800 km/s on 2019-09-01.  Currently, the solar wind speed is still elevated with values of around 560 km/s.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2019-08-31T18:50Z.  These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above (see notifications 20190831-AL-003, 20190831-AL-004, 20190902-AL-001, 20190904-AL-001).  The fluxes are still currently elevated above the threshold with values around 160,000 pfu. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2019-09-04T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2019-09-10T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.  There are only a few small active regions present on the solar surface.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2019-09-07.  Currently, the solar wind speed detected by ACE at L1 is still elevated due to the coronal hole high speed stream detected around 2019-08-30 and the > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt is elevated above the threshold of 10^5 pfu with values of around 160,000 pfu.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
