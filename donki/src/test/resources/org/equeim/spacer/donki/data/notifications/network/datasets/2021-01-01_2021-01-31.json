This CME likely overtook another slower S-type CME that was detected as a partial halo CME in SOHO C2 at 2021-01-01T22:00Z (see notifications 20210102-AL-001 and 20210104-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic period of 2021-01-05T12:00Z-15:00Z.  This may be associated with an interplanetary shock and magnetic field fluctuations detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE after 2021-01-05T12:20Z (see notification 20210105-AL-001), which may be the combined arrivals of the CMEs described above with a possible coronal hole high speed stream.

Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the CMEs may have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth. Simulations indicate that the flank of the CMEs will reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2021-01-05T20:30Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 2-3 (below minor).\n   \n\nUpdated CME parameters are (event downgraded to S-type):\n\n1: Start time of the event: 2021-01-01T22:00Z.\n\nEstimated speed: ~372 km/s.\n\nEstimated opening half-angle: 25 deg.\n\nDirection (lon./lat.): 15/-22 in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial coordinates.\n\nActivity ID: 2021-01-01T22:00:00-CME-001\n\n\n2: Start time of the event: 2021-01-02T11:24Z.\n\nEstimated speed: ~626 km/s.\n\nEstimated opening half-angle: 30 deg.\n\nDirection (lon./lat.): 44/-26 in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial coordinates.\n\nActivity ID: 2021-01-02T11:24:00-CME-001\n\n\nLinks to the movies of the modeled event (includes CME(s): 2021-01-01T22:00:00-CME-001, 2021-01-02T11:24:00-CME-001):\n\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20210102_072700_2.0_anim.tim-den.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20210102_072700_2.0_anim.tim-vel.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20210102_072700_2.0_anim.tim-den-Stereo_A.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20210102_072700_2.0_anim.tim-den-Stereo_B.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20210102_072700_2.0_anim.tim-vel-Stereo_A.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20210102_072700_2.0_anim.tim-vel-Stereo_B.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20210102_072700_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20210102_072700_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_STA_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20210102_072700_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_STB_timeline.gif\n\n\n## Notes: \n\n\nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttps://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20210102-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/16307/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-01-02T20:42Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-01-02T20:42:46Z\n## Message ID: 20210102-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
