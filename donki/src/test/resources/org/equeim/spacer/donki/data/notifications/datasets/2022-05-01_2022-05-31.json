Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B, Mars and STEREO A. For 25 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO B between about 2022-05-27T13:29Z and 2022-05-28T05:04Z (average arrival 2022-05-27T23:32Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2022-05-29T02:29Z and 2022-05-29T20:23Z (average arrival 2022-05-29T11:45Z) for 24% of simulations.\n- STEREO A between about 2022-05-28T03:42Z and 2022-05-28T04:54Z (average arrival 2022-05-28T04:18Z) for 8% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-05-27T12:12Z and 2022-05-28T03:25Z (average arrival 2022-05-27T19:50Z) for 24% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 67% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-05-26_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131/20220525_183800_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-05-26_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131/20220525_183800_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-05-26_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131/20220525_183800_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-05-26_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131/20220525_183800_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-05-26_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131/20220525_183800_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-05-26_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131/20220525_183800_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131_Mars_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-05-26_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131/20220525_183800_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-05-26_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131/20220525_183800_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131_STA_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-05-26_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131/20220525_183800_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2022-05-26_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131/20220525_183800_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX131_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set.

There were 6 C-type CMEs(see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-05-20T12:23Z may reach STEREO B at 2022-05-23T04:31Z and arrive as a glancing blow at Mars at 2022-05-24T20:00Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2022-05-24T01:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220520-AL-001).\n\nIt was also estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-05-21T00:12Z may impact STEREO B at 2022-05-24T05:34Z and may arrive as a glancing blow to NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-05-24T11:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly expected maximum Kp index was 3-4 (below minor) (see notification 20220522-AL-001). Additionally, an ensemble simulation of this CME with 24 ensemble members estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B between about 2022-05-23T03:57Z and 2022-05-24T09:14Z (average arrival 2022-05-23T14:57Z) for 83% of simulations and NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-05-23T06:45Z and 2022-05-24T10:13Z (average arrival 2022-05-23T16:19Z) for 66% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 52% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor) (see notification 20220522-AL-002).\n\nFurthermore, it was estimated that the C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-05-23T08:24Z may reach STEREO A at 2022-05-26T11:30Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220524-AL-001).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 4 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2022-05-23T13:25Z.  The elevated energetic electron flux levels were caused by a high speed stream starting on 2022-05-20, reaching a maximum speed of approximately 642 km/s (see notifications 20220523-AL-001, 20220523-AL-002).  This high speed stream was preceded by a weak interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-05-19T13:17Z.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux levels mentioned above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-05-18  21:56:00  22:08:00  22:02:00   M1.1   N22E23 (13014) \n2022-05-19  07:00:00  07:31:00  07:19:00   M5.6   N18E28 (13017) \n2022-05-19  10:00:00  10:20:00  10:09:00   M1.5   N21E16 (13014) \n2022-05-19  15:05:00  15:23:00  15:16:00   M1.1   N21E08 (13014) \n2022-05-20  07:35:00  07:49:00  07:45:00   M3.0   N19E00 (13014) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-05-21T00:12Z     ~569            C                25/28                33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-05-18T07:38Z     ~589            C               177/6                 34                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-05-20T12:23Z     ~875            C                40/-11               22                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-05-23T08:24Z     ~754            C               -76/-4                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-23T18:48Z     ~503            C              -168/46                50                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-24T23:11Z     ~708            C              -136/25                37                          SOHO, STEREO A \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-05-25T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-05-31T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period.  Currently, there are nine numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk.  Active Region 13014 (N22W62) has been the source of four of the five M-class flares during the reporting period and is expected to continue flaring activity until it rotates beyond the western limb by 2022-05-27.  Active Region 13017 (N13W42) has been the source of one M-class flare during the reporting period and may possibly remain active until it rotates over the western limb by 2022-05-28.  Active Region 13023 (S12E69) rotated onto the Earth-facing disk on 2022-05-24 and is expected to produce flaring and CMEs during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between below minor and minor levels during the outlook period due a northern coronal hole that crossed the Earth-facing central meridian on 2022-05-23 and may become geoeffective around 2022-05-26.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220525-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/20332/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-05-25T14:28Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-05-25T14:28:13Z\n## Message ID: 20220525-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\nSTEREO B between about 2022-05-23T03:57Z and 2022-05-24T09:14Z (average arrival 2022-05-23T14:57Z) for 83% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2022-05-23T06:45Z and 2022-05-24T10:13Z (average arrival 2022-05-23T16:19Z) for 66% of simulations.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate to strong levels during this reporting period with 6 M-class flares, as well as two O-type and 13 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-05-11T18:48Z may reach Mars at 2022-05-15T18:08Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2022-05-14T19:20Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2022-05-13T00:35Z, and Solar Orbiter at 2022-05-13T15:56Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20220512-AL-001). It was also estimated that the combined leading edge of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-05-13T08:48Z and the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-05-13T11:36Z may reach Parker Solar Probe at 2022-05-14T23:41Z. The leading edge of the earlier of these two CMEs may reach Mars at 2022-05-17T11:53Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2022-05-16T18:03Z, while the flank of the later of these two CMEs may reach Solar Orbiter at 2022-05-15T20:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (notification 20220513-AL-001).\n\nIt was also estimated that the combined leading edge of the C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-05-17T05:48Z and the closely following S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-05-17T06:48Z may reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-05-20T05:30Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 3-5 (below minor to minor) (see notification 20220518-AL-001). \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest values of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods from 2022-05-15T00:00Z-06:00Z. These slightly elevated values of Kp may have been caused by the combined effect of the possible arrival at L1 around 2022-05-14T14:00Z of a C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-05-10T14:48Z, followed by the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 later on 2022-05-14. The solar wind speed reached a maximum value of approximately 580 km/s on 2022-05-16. Further analysis is still ongoing.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were slightly elevated above background levels towards the beginning of the reporting period around 2022-05-11. These slight enhancements may have been caused by the M2.6 flare peaking at 2022-05-11T18:58Z and the associated C-type CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-05-11T18:48Z (see notification 20220512-AL-001). The source of the flare and the CME was likely Active Region 13004, which had by then rotated off the Earth-facing disk.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-05-11  16:35:00  16:58:00  16:49:00   M1.6   S24E36 ( 13007 ) \n2022-05-11  18:13:00  19:27:00  18:58:00   M2.6   S13W98 ( 13004 ) \n2022-05-11  19:27:00  19:35:00  19:31:00   M2.2   S24E35 ( 13007 ) \n2022-05-12  20:04:00  20:27:00  20:19:00   M1.3   N17E90 ( 13011 ) \n2022-05-14  23:58:00  00:17:00  00:08:00   M2.2   N13E90 ( 13017 ) \n2022-05-16  13:10:00  13:44:00  13:27:00   M2.4   N13E75 ( 13017 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-05-17T05:48Z     ~534            C               -39/-2                34                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-05-11T09:23Z     ~755            C              -131/-5                43                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-11T18:48Z     ~901           C               117/-3                50                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-11T21:12Z     ~577            C              -124/13                34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-12T03:24Z     ~791            C               -60/8                 22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-12T08:00Z     ~987            C               -52/23                23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-12T20:36Z     ~778            C               -98/14                28                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-05-13T08:48Z     ~738            C               137/-26               30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-13T11:23Z     ~603            C               -90/14                37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-13T11:36Z     ~649            C                83/-11               35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-13T16:12Z     ~524            C               151/-40               27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-13T19:12Z     ~610            C               -89/27                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-14T13:23Z     ~658            C              -147/13                23                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-05-14T18:36Z     ~1038           O               -78/-43               17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-16T18:12Z     ~586            C               -75/-38               21                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-05-18T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-05-24T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels throughout the outlook period.  Currently, there are seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk, while several more Active Regions have recently decayed to plages.  Active Region 13014 (N22E21) has been the source of numerous C-class flaring in the past few days and is expected to continue flaring activity during the rest of the outlook period.  Active Region 13007 (S23W57)  has been mostly inactive lately and should rotate beyond the west limb by 2022-05-21. The remaining numbered active regions have been mostly quiet. Two unnumbered active regions behind the East limb of the Earth-facing disk will rotate onto the disk within the next day. One of them (approximately at N15) has produced multiple lower C-class flares today. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period due to the possible L1 arrival on 2022-05-20 of the combined front of the C-type CME first detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-05-17T05:48Z and another (S-type) CME  first detected by STEREO COR2A at 2022-05-17T06:48Z. The CMEs are predicted to reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2022-05-20T05:30Z (plus minus 7 hours), with the roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index 3-5 (below minor to minor).   \n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20220518-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/20248/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-05-18T20:30Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-05-18T20:30:44Z\n## Message ID: 20220518-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Currently, there are two Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13006 (S31W13) has been the source of an X1.5 flare and three M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to be a significant source of activity throughout the outlook period. Active Region 13007 (S22E38) has been the source of C-class flaring and one M-class flare and may also continue to be active throughout the outlook period. Active Region 13004, the source of four M-class flares, has rotated off the Earth-facing disk. There are currently several Active Regions on or just beyond the East limb in STEREO A imagery that may have been the source of recent activity as seen from STEREO A imagery. These may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk early in the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor levels during the outlook period.  A slight enhancement could be possible due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream currently stretching from around longitudes E15 to E35 on the Earth-facing disk, which may reach geoeffective longitudes around 2022-05-17.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20220511-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/20158/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-05-11T16:34Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-05-11T16:34:58Z\n## Message ID: 20220511-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest period of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods 2022-04-27T12:00Z-15:00Z and 2022-04-27T21:00Z to 2022-04-28T00:00Z. This minor geomagnetic storm was possibly caused by the arrival detected at L1 of a coronal hole high speed stream on 2022-04-27 associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-04-27T02:50Z (see notification 20220427-AL-002).  An additional period of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic period 2022-04-30T03:00Z-06:00Z and may possibly have been caused by the arrival detected at L1 of the C-type CME first observed at 2022-04-27T14:53Z (see notifications 20220427-AL-003, 20220428-AL-001), which may be associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at 2022-04-29T23:27Z (see notification 20220430-AL-002).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2022-04-29T11:50Z.  The elevated energetic electron flux levels may be caused by a coronal hole high speed stream that might have arrived on 2022-04-27 (see notifications 20220429-AL-001, 20220429-AL-002, and 20220501-AL-001).  The energetic electron flux crossed the threshold again starting at 2022-05-03T08:20Z (see notification 20220503-AL-001), likely caused by the arrival at L1 of the CME initially detected by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-04-27T14:53Z described above.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A was at background level for the entire reporting period.  The energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES was slightly elevated beginning 2022-04-29T10:50Z.  This elevation was associated with the M1.2 class flare from Active Region 12996 that peaked around 2022-04-29T07:30Z and associated O-type CME initially detected by STEREO A COR2 at 2022-04-29T07:38Z.  Levels were elevated for a few days but remained below the threshold level of 10 pfu for the entire reporting period.\n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the ongoing radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-04-29  07:15:00  07:42:00  07:30:00   M1.2   N26W39 (12996) \n2022-04-29  18:01:00  18:22:00  18:10:00   M1.2   N14W90 (12994) \n2022-04-30  04:46:00  05:07:00  05:01:00   M2.6   N15W92 (12994) \n2022-04-30  05:25:00  05:40:00  05:34:00   M1.4   N15W93 (12994) \n2022-04-30  09:48:00  10:05:00  09:58:00   M4.8   N15W94 (12994) \n2022-04-30  13:37:00  13:52:00  13:47:00   X1.1   N15W93 (12994) \n2022-04-30  19:42:00  19:54:00  19:47:00   M1.9   N15W102 (12994)\n2022-05-03  07:34:00  08:01:00  07:53:00   M1.3   S30E85           \n2022-05-03  13:09:00  13:31:00  13:25:00   X1.1   S30E85           \n\n\nCME Measurement Parameters (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-04-27T08:48Z     ~709            C                25/46                31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-27T14:53Z     ~970            C                28/29                36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-29T07:38Z     ~1397           O                37/21                48                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-04-27T02:00Z     ~588            C              -107/24                36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-27T21:12Z     ~808            C               124/33                29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-28T03:09Z     ~1008           O                43/47                24                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2022-04-30T14:00Z     ~670            C               103/1                 37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-04-30T20:00Z     ~740            C               108/4                 47                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-01T05:00Z     ~556            C               109/6                 25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-01T08:36Z     ~886            C               114/21                34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-01T13:36Z     ~1304           O                51/22                14                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-01T21:36Z     ~1013           O                76/28                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-05-02T16:24Z     ~1300           O              NONE/22                30                          SOHO\n2022-05-03T13:25Z     ~1121           O                93/54                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2022-05-04T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2022-05-10T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels throughout the outlook period.  Currently, there are eight numbered Active Regions across the Earth-facing disk.  Active Region 13004 (S15W07) is the only one of those with significant activity or complexity, and was the source of an M5.7 flare on 2022-05-04.  This region may continue to be active throughout the outlook period.  Additionally, an unnumbered active region near the eastern limb (near latitude S30) has been the source of an X1.1 and two M-class flares since its rotation onto the Earth-facing disk on 2022-05-03 and may continue to be a significant source of activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period due to the previously mentioned radiation belt enhancement which began on 2022-05-03.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"FLR","messageID":"20220504-AL-004","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/20070/1","messageIssueTime":"2022-05-04T12:02Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - M5.7 Flare\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2022-05-04T12:02:11Z\n## Message ID: 20220504-AL-004\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
