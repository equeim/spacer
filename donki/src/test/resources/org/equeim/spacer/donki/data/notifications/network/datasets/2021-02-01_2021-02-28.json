This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at relatively low levels during the reporting period. There were two C-type CMEs (see details below). Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA's Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the CME initially observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2021-02-20T11:36Z would impact STEREO A at 2021-02-23T09:17Z, Mars at 2021-02-25T14:42Z, and missions near Earth at 2021-02-23T00:07Z (plus minus 7 hours)(see notification 20210221-AL-003). The arrival of this CME was observed at STEREO A around 2021-02-23T10:32Z. Ongoing analysis indicates that this CME may have arrived at L1 on 2021-02-23 and will be further evaluated in the coming days.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 4 for the reporting period. The highest values of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods 2021-02-19T12:00Z-24:00Z, 2021-02-20T06:00Z-09:00Z, 2021-02-20T15:00Z to 2021-02-21T15:00Z, 2021-02-22T00:00Z-06:00Z, and 2021-02-23T00:00Z-03:00Z.  These slightly elevated values of Kp were associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2021-02-19. Solar wind speeds from this high speed stream reached values around 620 km/s on 2021-02-20 and decreased to around 500 km/s by the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES exceeded the threshold level of 1000 pfu at 2021-02-21T05:35Z (see notifications 20210221-AL-001, 20210221-AL-002, and 20210223-AL-001) and remained elevated throughout the reporting period. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 on 2021-02-19.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement mentioned above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-02-20T11:36Z     ~680            C               -31/-18               50                          SOHO                              \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2021-02-21T01:48Z     ~501            C               -20/-17               22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2021-02-24T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2021-03-02T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at low levels for the outlook period. There are no new active regions due to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk in the next several days, as seen by STEREO-A EUVI images.  Active Region 2804 produced frequent B-class flaring during the reporting period and is expected to continue producing frequent B-class flaring during the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at low levels throughout the outlook period.  The high speed stream which began 2021-02-19 should subside early during the outlook period, but Radiation Belt Enhancement is expected to continue through the early part of the outlook period. The current disturbance in the magnetic field seen at L1 on 2021-02-24 may have been caused by the arrival of the 2021-02-21 CME following the 2021-02-20 CME.\n\nA northward extension of the south pole coronal hole, near S25E30 at the end of the reporting period, may possibly become geoeffective near the end of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20210223-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/16518/1","messageIssueTime":"2021-02-23T13:59Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2021-02-23T13:59:10Z\n## Message ID: 20210223-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods 2021-02-07T00:00Z-06:00Z.
