CMEs originate from the vicinity of the active region 12535 currently located at N07E08. The CMEs were fairly slow and have very faint signatures in the coronagraph imagery making them difficult to analyze accurately.  Although the CMEs appear slow, S-type CMEs (<500 km/s), due to their proximity to a coronal hole and corresponding corotating interaction region (CIR), there is a possibility for moderate geomagnetic activity around 2016-05-01 to 2016-05-02. The elevation in activity can be caused by possibly merged CIR and CME structures impacting the EarthÂ’s magnetosphere.\n\nActivity IDs: 2016-04-28T02:12:00-CME-001, 2016-04-28T06:36:00-CME-001, 2016-04-28T07:24:00-CME-001\n\n## Notes: \n\n\n[1] http://iswawiki.gsfc.nasa.gov/wiki/index.php/Glossary/Heliospheric_Earth_Equatorial_coordinates\n\nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There were 2 C-type CMEs (see details below).   A CME arrival was detected at STEREO A magnetic field and plasma data around 2016-04-27T09:00Z corresponding to the halo CME that started on 2016-04-25T05:12Z (see notification 20160425-AL-001).  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2016-04-23T21:00Z-24:00Z.  This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival detected by ACE at L1 of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2016-04-22.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-04-24T04:24Z     ~510            C               115/24                40                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2016-04-25T05:12Z     ~695            C              -165/5                 45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-04-27T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-05-03T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.  There are several active regions present in the solar disk, especially an active region on the far side seen in the northwest of the STEREO A EUVI images, that are capable of producing solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  Geomagnetic activity is also expected to increase due to the arrival of a solar sector boundary crossing around 2016-04-29.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2016-04-13T00:00Z-03:00Z and 2016-04-14T09:00Z-12:00Z.  These slight increases in geomagnetic activity were associated with the arrival detected by ACE at L1 of a coronal hole high speed stream on 2016-04-12 and the weak interplanetary shock detected around 2016-04-14T06:50Z of a CME event that started on 2016-04-10T11:00Z, respectively (see notification 20160412-AL-001).  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was slightly elevated at the beginning of the reporting period due to the coronal hole high speed steam described above, but remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES was slightly elevated on 2016-04-18 due the M6.7 class flare and its associated CME, but remained under the threshold of 10 pfu for the entire reporting period.  The 13-100 MeV proton flux at STEREO A was at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2016-04-18  00:14:00  00:39:00  00:29:00   M6.7   N10W51 ( 12529 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-04-18T00:36Z     ~689            C                58/9                 37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-04-20T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-04-26T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.

There are a few active regions on the solar disk capable of producing solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Especially an active region that is just rotating to the Earth's facing solar disk on the east limb has a potential for additional activity.  The geomagnetic activity may increase around 2016-04-07 due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream.  \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
