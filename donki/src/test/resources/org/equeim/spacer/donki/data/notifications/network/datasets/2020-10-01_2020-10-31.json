There was one back-sided C-type CME with speed of 540 km/s.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4 occurred during the synoptic periods:\n2020-10-21T06:00Z to 2020-10-21T09:00Z; \n2020-10-23T18:00Z to 2020-10-24T09:00Z; \n2020-10-25T12:00Z to 2020-10-25T15:00Z; \n2020-10-25T18:00Z to 2020-10-25T21:00Z; \n2020-10-26T03:00Z to 2020-10-26T06:00Z; \n2020-10-26T12:00Z to 2020-10-26T15:00Z; \n2020-10-27T06:00Z to 2020-10-27T09:00Z.\nThe increases in geomagnetic activity on 2020-10-23 and thereafter were associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream on 2020-10-23; the solar wind speed reached values in excess of 500 km/s for the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu on 2020-10-25T12:00Z and remained at elevated levels for the rest of the reporting period (see notifications 20201025-AL-001, 20201027-AL-001). The elevated flux levels were the result of the aforementioned coronal hole high speed stream that increased geomagnetic activity.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate during the reporting period due to the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2020-10-26T18:09Z     ~540            C              -151/-3                26                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-10-28T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-11-03T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity for the outlook period is expected to be between low and minor levels. Active Region 2778 currently has a Beta-Gamma magnetic classification and has produced numerous C-class flares; AR2778 should rotate off the Earth-facing disk in the latter half of the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be between low to minor levels for the outlook period. A S-type (<500 km/s) CME associated with a filament eruption near N30E10 on the Earth-facing disk occurred late into the evening of 2020-10-26; current estimates place an arrival at Earth sometime around 2020-11-01T00:00Z (+/- 7 hours). The arrival signature is likely to be complicated due to the possible arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream arriving the same day. GOES \"greater than 2.0 MeV\" integral electron fluxes are likely to remain elevated for the remainder of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

There were no significant flares or CMEs.\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at low levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <= 2 for the reporting period. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu on 2020-10-07 and 2020-10-10 (see notifications 20201007-AL-001 and 20201010-AL-001). These elevated flux levels at the beginning of the reporting period are associated with the near coincident arrivals of a slow S-type (<500 km/s) CME that was first seen in the coronagraphs at 2020-09-30T12:09Z and a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 on 2020-10-07; the arrivals of these transients resulted in an average solar wind speed around 410 km/s early 2020-10-08.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-10-14T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-10-20T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be at low to minor levels for the upcoming week. Active regions 2774 and 2775 should remain on the Earth-facing disk for the next few days, with an additional unnumbered active region rotating in from the Eastern limb. Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week. Coronal hole high speed streams are unlikely during the outlook period as there are no significant structures across the Earth-facing disk.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream on 2020-09-27.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-10-07T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-10-13T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at low levels for the upcoming week. There are currently no significant active regions on the solar surface as seen in the available imagery. A continual enhancement in the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES may be observed towards the beginning of the upcoming week. The integral electron flux has exceeded the 1000 pfu threshold starting at 2020-10-07T14:05Z (see notification 20201007-AL-001).
