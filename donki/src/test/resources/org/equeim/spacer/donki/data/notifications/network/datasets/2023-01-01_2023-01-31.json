The later enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-01-20, with solar wind reaching a maximum sustained speed of around 550 km/s.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-01-18  10:21:00  10:52:00  10:35:00   M1.8   S16E20 ( 13190 ) \n2023-01-19  04:00:00  04:09:00  04:03:00   M1.1   N12W42 ( 13196 ) \n2023-01-19  10:06:00  10:19:00  10:12:00   M1.7   N12E38 ( 13196 ) \n2023-01-19  10:26:00  10:29:00  10:27:00   M1.0   N12E40 ( 13196 ) \n2023-01-22  12:12:00  12:34:00  12:26:00   M1.1   S20W40 ( 13190 ) \n2023-01-22  16:49:00  17:10:00  17:02:00   M1.6   S25W53 ( 13194 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-01-19T11:36Z     ~826            C               -35/-2                26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-20T13:38Z     ~806            C                41/-36               37                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-01-20T16:12Z     ~684            C                 7/-32               24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-01-18T03:48Z     ~906            C               -59/23                10                          SOHO                              \n2023-01-18T05:48Z     ~788            C               -59/21                10                          SOHO                              \n2023-01-18T13:36Z     ~864            C               134/-16               50                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-18T19:38Z     ~664            C               -87/-31               33                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-01-19T19:48Z     ~1052           O                94/33                35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-21T02:00Z     ~630            C                32/-48               16                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-22T10:48Z     ~717            C               -99/22                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-22T11:24Z     ~591            C              -174/-34               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-23T05:00Z     ~643            C         NONE(POS)/-54               30                          SOHO                              \n2023-01-23T19:12Z     ~713            C               161/28                31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-24T21:12Z     ~931            C                90/38                24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-01-25T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-01-31T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently nine numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13190 (S14W86) and Active Region 13196 (N15W42) produced a majority of the lower level M-class flaring observed during the reporting period. These Active Regions may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity during the outlook period. Additionally, there are two unnumbered Active Regions visible along the eastern limb at latitudes around S18 and S20 that may exhibit flaring activity.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor during the outlook period. There may be minor enhancements in geomagnetic activity around 2023-01-28 due to the anticipated arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream from a coronal hole which reached the central meridian on 2023-01-24. \n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230124-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/23434/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-01-24T16:56Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Parker Solar Probe)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-01-24T16:56:24Z\n## Message ID: 20230124-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-01-21T23:29Z and 2023-01-22T20:33Z (average arrival 2023-01-22T07:54Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2023-01-24T00:25Z and 2023-01-25T03:00Z (average arrival 2023-01-24T11:22Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-01-22T03:08Z and 2023-01-22T18:36Z (average arrival 2023-01-22T11:15Z) for 79% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 92% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-20_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166/20230119_113605_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-20_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166/20230119_113605_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-20_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166/20230119_113605_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-20_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166/20230119_113605_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-20_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166/20230119_113605_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166_arrival_Mars.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-20_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166/20230119_113605_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166_Mars_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-20_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166/20230119_113605_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-20_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166/20230119_113605_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2023-01-19T11:36:00-CME-001) is also predicted to have an impact at Solar Orbiter at 2023-01-22T04:34Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20230119-AL-001).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-20_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166/Detailed_results_20230119_113605_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX166.txt\n###\n\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230120-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/23389/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-01-20T17:28Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-REx, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-01-20T17:28:19Z\n## Message ID: 20230120-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were 4 O-type CMEs and 10 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in the STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2023-01-12T02:36Z was predicted to impact Missions near Earth at 2023-01-15T10:00Z (glancing blow) with a maximum Kp index 2-3 (below minor) and STEREO B at 2023-01-15T08:00Z (glancing blow) (see notifications 20230112-AL-002, 20230113-AL-002). Additionally, an ensemble for this CME with 24 members was made (see notification 20230113-AL-002 and full details at https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-12_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164/Detailed_results_20230112_023600_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164.txt). The arrival of this CME at L1 might have been detected by DSCOVR and ACE on 2023-01-14T21:50Z, with an associated interplanetary shock (see notification 20230115-AL-003). Analysis of this arrival signature is still ongoing.  \n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-01-10T09:24Z  Solar Orbiter (glancing blow) at 2023-01-13T04:00Z (see notification 20230111-AL-003)\n2023-01-10T16:09Z  Solar Orbiter (glancing blow) at 2023-01-13T04:00Z (see notification 20230111-AL-003)\n2023-01-11T01:25Z  Solar Orbiter (glancing blow) at 2023-01-14T06:00Z (see notification 20230112-AL-001)\n2023-01-11T01:36Z  Solar Orbiter (glancing blow) at 2023-01-14T06:00Z (see notification 20230112-AL-001)\n2023-01-12T22:12Z  OSIRIS-REx at 2023-01-16T10:47Z (see notification 20230113-AL-001)\n2023-01-15T03:48Z  Mars at 2023-01-19T12:11Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-01-17T11:48Z, and STEREO A at 2023-01-17T15:11Z (see notification 20230115-AL-004)\n2023-01-15T05:00Z  Mars at 2023-01-19T12:11Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-01-17T11:48Z, and STEREO A at 2023-01-17T15:11Z (see notification 20230115-AL-004)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2023-01-15T00:00Z-03:00Z and 2023-01-15T21:00Z to 2023-01-16T00:00Z. These elevated values of Kp may have been associated with the arrival at L1 on 2023-01-14T21:50Z of the above mentioned C-type CME first visible in the STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2023-01-12T02:36Z (notifications 20230112-AL-002, 20230113-AL-002, 20230115-AL-003), coming on the heels of the coronal hole high speed stream that arrived on 2023-01-13, reaching a maximum sustained speeds of just over 550 km/s. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES remained below threshold levels throughout the entire reporting period but was briefly elevated above background levels on 2023-01-13, possibly following M1.0 class flare from Active Region 13182 peaking at 2023-01-12T19:13Z (and maybe further enhanced by the eruption and flare behind the west limb associated with the C-type CME first seen by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-01-12T22:12Z). The 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A remained below the threshold for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-01-11  00:39:00  01:10:00  00:59:00   M2.4   N25E64 ( 13186 ) \n2023-01-11  01:49:00  02:01:00  01:56:00   M5.6   S13E52 ( 13184 ) \n2023-01-11  05:31:00  06:29:00  06:09:00   M1.3   S17W50 ( 13181 ) \n2023-01-11  08:25:00  08:37:00  08:33:00   M3.1   N25E60 ( 13186 ) \n2023-01-12  05:53:00  06:33:00  06:18:00   M1.1   N22E47 ( 13186 ) \n2023-01-12  06:33:00  07:02:00  06:46:00   M1.5   N23E49 ( 13186 ) \n2023-01-12  11:08:00  11:46:00  11:28:00   M1.2   S12W75 ( 13181 ) \n2023-01-12  14:39:00  15:10:00  14:57:00   M1.0   S17W16 ( 13182 ) \n2023-01-12  19:03:00  19:24:00  19:13:00   M1.0   S17W15 ( 13182 ) \n2023-01-13  02:53:00  03:03:00  02:59:00   M1.4   N24E37 ( 13186 ) \n2023-01-13  10:05:00  10:19:00  10:15:00   M3.9   S19W83 ( 13181 ) \n2023-01-14  01:28:00  03:08:00  02:10:00   M1.3   N13E71 ( 13191 ) \n2023-01-14  20:06:00  20:28:00  20:21:00   M3.5   S17W43 ( 13182 ) \n2023-01-14  20:37:00  21:19:00  21:00:00   M4.6   S16W44 ( 13182 ) \n2023-01-15  03:08:00  04:08:00  03:42:00   M6.0   N13E56 ( 13191 ) \n2023-01-15  14:16:00  14:51:00  14:31:00   M4.8   S16E58 ( 13190 ) \n2023-01-17  23:16:00  23:44:00  23:29:00   M1.8   S17E24 ( 13190 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-01-12T02:36Z     ~645            C                24/33                32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-01-11T01:25Z     ~1100           O               -66/30                19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-11T01:36Z     ~869            C               -69/18                25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-11T08:48Z     ~1148           O               -93/63                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-11T09:48Z     ~908            C               -52/45                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-12T06:09Z     ~531            C               -90/-37               12                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-01-12T11:36Z     ~529            C               -85/21                16                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-12T22:12Z     ~766            C               122/-40               47                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-12T22:24Z     ~1181           O               122/-58               26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-13T16:53Z     ~645            C               131/-43               18                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-01-15T03:48Z     ~1024           O               -44/-19               29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-15T05:00Z     ~628            C               -56/-19               46                          SOHO                              \n2023-01-17T04:12Z     ~804            C                17/45                14                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-17T10:24Z     ~549            C                89/25                26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-01-18T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-01-24T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between moderate to high levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently 9 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13190 (S14E10) and 13191 (S11W02) are responsible for the vast majority of the M-class flares in the last five days, while Active Region 13192 (N19E16) has been the source of a lot of recent C-class flaring. These Active Regions are likely to exhibit notable flaring activity during the outlook period. Earlier in the reporting period, Active Region 13186 (N25W39) produced major M-class flares (with Active Regions 13181 and 13182, now rotated well off the Earth-facing disk, being the other major contributors). Active Region 13184 (S13W48) produced one M-class flare at the beginning of the reporting period. In addition, a yet unnumbered Active Region located around latitude N15, as seen in EUV imagery from SDO and STEREO A, is expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk in the next day and may exhibit flaring activity throughout the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be low to minor during the outlook period due to the currently developing arrival signature associated with the significant interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR at L1 at 2023-01-17T21:10Z (see notification 20230118-AL-001). This arrival could be the predicted glancing blow from an S-type CME first seen by SOHO at 2023-01-14T21:36Z or a glancing blow from an O-type CME first seen by SOHO at 2023-01-15T03:48Z (notification 20230115-AL-004). Around 2023-01-20, there might be additional increases in geomagnetic activity in the next few days due to the anticipated arrivals of coronal hole high speed streams from coronal holes crossing the central meridian on 2023-01-17.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230118-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/23360/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-01-18T18:41Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-REx, Parker Solar Probe)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-01-18T18:41:35Z\n## Message ID: 20230118-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO B. For 25 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO B between about 2023-01-14T18:57Z and 2023-01-15T13:53Z (average arrival 2023-01-15T04:25Z) for 8% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-01-14T20:24Z for 4% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 100% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-12_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164/20230112_023600_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-12_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164/20230112_023600_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-12_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164/20230112_023600_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-12_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164/20230112_023600_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-12_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164/20230112_023600_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164_arrival_STB.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-12_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164/20230112_023600_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164_STB_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-12_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164/Detailed_results_20230112_023600_ncmes1_sims25_HILOX164.txt\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230113-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/23292/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-01-13T15:33Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-REx)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-01-13T15:33:47Z\n## Message ID: 20230113-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There were 2 O-type CMEs and 15 C-type CMEs (see details below).  \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact Missions near Earth:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-01-04T08:48Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-01-07T18:00Z (glancing blow)\n2023-01-10T09:24Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-01-13T04:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230111-AL-003)\n2023-01-10T16:09Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-01-13T04:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230111-AL-003)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-01-04T06:00Z-09:00Z. This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of an S-type CME first seen in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-12-30T16:53Z associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-01-03T16:26Z (see notification 20230104-AL-001). \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES was briefly elevated above background levels after the M5.1 class flare starting at 2023-01-10T00:09Z but remained below threshold levels throughout the entire reporting period. The 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A remained below the threshold for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-01-06  00:43:00  01:07:00  00:57:00   X1.2   S20E81 ( 13182 ) \n2023-01-07  00:40:00  01:02:00  00:52:00   M1.6   S21E67 ( 13182 ) \n2023-01-08  08:39:00  09:06:00  08:54:00   M1.2   S14E89 ( 13184 ) \n2023-01-08  09:12:00  10:13:00  09:48:00   M1.4   S16E89 ( 13184 ) \n2023-01-08  14:51:00  15:21:00  15:07:00   M1.4   S16E89 ( 13184 ) \n2023-01-08  19:02:00  19:19:00  19:11:00   M1.0   S14E89 ( 13184 ) \n2023-01-09  00:51:00  01:19:00  01:02:00   M1.1   S13E81 ( 13184 ) \n2023-01-09  08:45:00  09:16:00  09:01:00   M2.1   S20W25 ( 13181 ) \n2023-01-09  13:15:00  13:31:00  13:22:00   M1.0   S20W27 ( 13181 ) \n2023-01-09  18:37:00  18:57:00  18:50:00   X1.9   S13E71 ( 13184 ) \n2023-01-10  00:09:00  00:22:00  00:16:00   M5.1   N24E79 ( 13186 ) \n2023-01-10  02:08:00  02:24:00  02:16:00   M1.0   S14E65 ( 13184 ) \n2023-01-10  02:33:00  02:54:00  02:41:00   M2.6   S19W34 ( 13181 ) \n2023-01-10  10:59:00  11:12:00  11:08:00   M1.0   S14E60 ( 13184 ) \n2023-01-10  17:17:00  17:34:00  17:28:00   M1.3   N24E65 ( 13186 ) \n2023-01-10  17:44:00  17:52:00  17:48:00   M1.2   S14E57 ( 13184 ) \n2023-01-10  22:39:00  22:52:00  22:47:00   X1.0   N25E65 ( 13186 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-01-04T08:48Z     ~512            C               106/3                 17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-05T00:48Z     ~559            C            NONE(POS)/-47            15                          SOHO\n2023-01-06T01:25Z     ~892            C                65/18                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-06T04:00Z     ~535            C              -127/53                25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-08T18:48Z     ~522            C              -102/-36               36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-09T04:36Z     ~628            C            NONE(POS)/66             19                          SOHO\n2023-01-09T05:12Z     ~943            C            NONE(POS)/28             10                          SOHO\n2023-01-09T09:48Z     ~654            C               -95/21                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-09T14:46Z     ~615            C              -104/21                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-09T18:12Z     ~694            C               -93/22                25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-09T19:12Z     ~607            C               -90/27                23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-09T21:24Z     ~653            C               -90/24                25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-09T23:12Z     ~883            C               -90/14                11                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-10T00:36Z     ~1004           O               -79/17                31                          SOHO                              \n2023-01-10T03:36Z     ~521            C               -75/20                26                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-10T09:24Z     ~700            C               -72/10                21                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-10T16:09Z     ~1214           O               -67/20                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-01-11T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-01-17T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between moderate to high levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently 5 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13182 (S16W04), 13184 (S13E43), and newly numbered Active Region 13186 (N25E55) each produced an X-class flare during the reporting period as well as a majority of lower level M-class flares. These Active Regions may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity during the outlook period. Additionally, there is an unnumbered Active Region located around latitude S25 which is starting to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk as seen in EUV imagery from SDO and STEREO A and may exhibit flaring activity throughout the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be low to minor during the outlook period. There may be minor enhancement in the geomagnetic activity due to the anticipated arrival of an S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-01-08T05:00Z which is predicted to impact missions near Earth around 2023-01-12.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230111-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/23251/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-01-11T21:14Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CMEs (Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-01-11T21:14:03Z\n## Message ID: 20230111-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate levels during this reporting period with 5 M-class flares, 1 O-type CME, and 7 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the S-type CME first visible in the STEREO A COR2 imagery at 2022-12-30T16:53Z with a measured speed of 452 km/s was predicted to impact Missions near Earth at 2023-01-02T20:00Z (glancing blow) with a maximum Kp index 2-4 (below minor). It will also have minor impacts to Mars at 2023-01-05T12:00Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-01-03T02:00Z, STEREO A at 2023-01-03T06:00Z, and STEREO B at 2023-01-03T00:00Z (see notifications 20221230-AL-001, 20230101-AL-001, 20230101-AL-002).\n\nAn ensemble was created for the CME with 24 members. The CME was estimated to reach NASA Missions near Earth between about 2023-01-02T18:20Z and 2023-01-03T04:45Z (average arrival 2023-01-02T21:59Z) for 12% of simulations. The full results can be found here: https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-01_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163/Detailed_results_20221230_165300_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163.txt (see notification 20230101-AL-002). The arrival of this CME was likely detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 023-01-03T16:26Z (see notification 20230104-AL-001). This arrival signature is still developing.\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-01-03T06:36Z  Parker Solar Probe at 2023-01-04T10:06Z and Juno at 2023-01-15T04:18Z (see notifications 20230103-AL-001, 20230103-AL-002)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2022-12-30T00:00Z-03:00Z, 2022-12-30T12:00Z-15:00Z, and 2023-01-04T06:00Z-09:00Z.  The enhancements of geomagnetic activity on 2022-12-30 were associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-12-29.  The enhancement of geomagnetic activity on 2023-01-04 was associated with the arrival of an S-type CME first seen in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-12-30T16:53Z associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-01-03T16:26Z (see notification 20230104-AL-001).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained elevated throughout the entire reporting period due to a threshold crossing during the previous reporting period beginning at 2022-12-27T17:05Z (see notifications 20221227-AL-003, 20221229-AL-001, 20221231-AL-001, and 20230102-AL-001).  This enhancement was initially caused by the arrival of the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2022-12-24T02:48Z associated with the interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2022-12-26T00:33Z (see notification 20221226-AL-001) with additional influence from a coronal hole high speed stream that arrived on 2022-12-24, followed by further influence from a subsequent coronal hole high speed stream starting on 2022-12-29. The energetic electron flux levels subsided to background levels early on 2023-01-04.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2022-12-29  06:32:00  08:08:00  07:27:00   M1.2   N17E90 ( 13180 ) \n2022-12-29  18:11:00  18:26:00  18:20:00   M2.1   N20E90 ( 13180 ) \n2022-12-29  18:26:00  18:43:00  18:33:00   M2.4   N20E90 ( 13180 ) \n2022-12-30  15:24:00  15:32:00  15:28:00   M1.4   N18E08 ( 13176 ) \n2022-12-30  19:26:00  19:47:00  19:38:00   M3.7   N18E08 ( 13176 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2022-12-30T11:36Z     ~770            C              -156/-51               22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2022-12-31T00:48Z     ~527            C        NONE (POS)/-69               14                          SOHO                              \n2022-12-31T18:00Z     ~584            C                90/48                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-01T20:24Z     ~503            C        NONE (POS)/0                 50                          SOHO                \n2023-01-02T18:36Z     ~726            C        NONE (POS)/-67               31                          SOHO                \n2023-01-03T06:36Z     ~1035           O              -131/-13               53                          SOHO                              \n2023-01-03T09:48Z     ~827            C              -119/30                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-01-03T14:12Z     ~968            C                40/20                12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n              \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-01-04T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-01-10T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels with the chance for higher level activity throughout the outlook period. There are 6 numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk.  Active Regions 13180 (N18E07) and 13176 (N19W52) showed the highest level flaring activity (several lower M-class flares each) during the reporting period and may continue to produce higher level flaring activity throughout the outlook period.  Active Regions 13175 (S22W72) and 13179 (N13W89) are expected to rotate off of the Earth-facing disk by 2023-01-06. Recently, Active Region 13177 (S18W18) and an unnumbered Active Region rotating onto the Earth-facing disk in the SE have produced numerous C-class flares, both may continue to display increased activity.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be low to minor during the outlook period due to the ongoing arrival of the S-type CME first seen in STEREO A COR2 at 2022-12-30T16:53Z (see details mentioned above).  Additional increases in geomagnetic activity may occur as early as 2023-01-05 from the anticipated arrival of several coronal hole high speed streams seen near the central meridian on 2023-01-01.\n\nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20230104-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/23128/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-01-04T13:27Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-01-04T13:27:24Z\n## Message ID: 20230104-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \n\nEnsemble modeling update on CME with ID 2022-12-30T16:53:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20230101-AL-001). Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-01-03T00:47Z and 2023-01-03T08:35Z (average arrival 2023-01-03T04:13Z) for 66% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-01-02T18:20Z and 2023-01-03T04:45Z (average arrival 2023-01-02T21:59Z) for 12% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 89% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-01_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163/20221230_165300_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-01_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163/20221230_165300_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-01_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163/20221230_165300_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-01_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163/20221230_165300_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-01_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163/20221230_165300_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-01_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163/20221230_165300_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163_STA_stack.gif\n\n\n## Notes:\n\nThis CME is also predicted to have an impact at Mars at 2023-01-05T12:00Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-01-03T02:00Z, and STEREO B at 2023-01-03T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see previous notification 20230101-AL-001).\n\nThis CME event (2022-12-30T16:53:00-CME-001) is associated with M1.4 flare from AR 13176 (N19E08) with ID 2022-12-30T15:24:00-FLR-001 which peaked at 2022-12-30T15:28Z.\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-01-01_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163/Detailed_results_20221230_165300_ncmes1_sims24_HILOX163.txt\n\n\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230101-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/23091/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-01-01T17:31Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (Mars, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, STEREO B, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-01-01T17:31:09Z\n## Message ID: 20230101-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that this CME may affect Mars (minor impact), Solar Orbiter (minor impact), STEREO A (minor impact), and STEREO B (minor impact).  The leading edge of the CME will reach Mars at 2023-01-05T12:00Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-01-03T02:00Z, STEREO A at 2023-01-03T06:00Z, and STEREO B at 2023-01-03T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). \n\nThe simulation also indicates that the CME may have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth.  Simulations indicate that the flank of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2023-01-02T20:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 2-4 (below minor).\n   \n\nUpdated CME parameters are (event downgraded to S-type):\n\nStart time of the event: 2022-12-30T16:53Z.\n\nEstimated speed: ~452 km/s.\n\nEstimated opening half-angle: 32 deg.\n\nDirection (lon./lat.): 14/-24 in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial coordinates.\n\nActivity ID: 2022-12-30T16:53:00-CME-001\n\n\nLinks to the movies of the modeled event (includes CME: 2022-12-30T16:53:00-CME-001):\n\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20221231_003100_2.0_anim.tim-den.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20221231_003100_2.0_anim.tim-vel.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20221231_003100_2.0_anim.tim-den-Stereo_A.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20221231_003100_2.0_anim.tim-vel-Stereo_A.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20221231_003100_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20221231_003100_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_STA_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20221231_003100_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_STB_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20221231_003100_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_Mars_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20221231_003100_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_SolO_timeline.gif\n\n\n## Notes: \n\nThis CME event (2022-12-30T16:53:00-CME-001) is associated with M1.4 flare from AR 13176 (N19E08) with ID 2022-12-30T15:24:00-FLR-001 which peaked at 2022-12-30T15:28Z.\n\n\nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"}]
