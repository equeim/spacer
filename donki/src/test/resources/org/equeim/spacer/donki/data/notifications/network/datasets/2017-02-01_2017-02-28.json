No CMEs traveling with a speed over 500km/s were observed in the available coronagraph imagery.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2017-02-17T03:00Z-12:00Z, 2017-02-17T15:00Z-18:00Z, 2017-02-17T21:00Z to 2017-02-18T06:00Z, and 2017-02-22T00:00Z-03:00Z.  The values of Kp=4 at the beginning of the reporting period were associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2017-02-16. The solar wind speed reached values of >600 km/s on 2017-02-19.  \n\nThe IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments at STEREO A detected the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-02-19.  The solar wind speed reached values >600 km/s on 2017-02-20.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-02-22T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-02-28T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the next reporting period.  Active region 12638 on the Earth's facing side may be capable of producing some low classification flares and CMEs.  The geomagnetic activity is expected to be enhanced for the upcoming reporting due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-02-23.

No CMEs faster than 500 km/s were detected in the coronagraph imagery.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2017-01-31T21:00Z to 2017-02-01T03:00Z.  This minor enhancement of geomagnetic activity is associated with a coronal hole high speed stream arrival detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2017-01-30.  Solar wind speed reached >750 km/s on 2017-01-31.  Previously, there was a smaller coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2017-02-26.  Solar wind speed reached values of >650km/s around 2017-01-27.  \n\nSTEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected arrivals of coronal holes high speed streams on 2017-01-28 and 2017-01-31.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. However, the flux levels became elevated and crossed the threshold around 2017-02-01T15:00Z due to the coronal hole high speed stream described above.   \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low during this reporting period.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-02-01T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-02-07T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be very low for the upcoming week.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be enhanced for the beginning of the next reporting period due to the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream on 2017-01-30.  Currently, the > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES is above the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2017-02-01T15:00Z. The geomagnetic Kp index has been Kp=5 for the synoptic periods of 2017-02-01T15:00Z-18:00Z and 2017-02-01T21:00Z-24:00Z.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
