The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index was 6-8 (moderate to severe). An ensemble simulation was performed for this CME with 32 members. For the ensemble, the CME was estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-04-23T10:51Z and 2023-04-24T11:38Z (average arrival 2023-04-23T19:36Z) for 100% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicated that there was a 58% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 5-7 range (minor to strong).

The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 4-6 (below minor to moderate). An ensemble was also performed for this CME with 24 members. For the ensemble, the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-04-27T01:06Z and 2023-04-27T11:02Z (average arrival 2023-04-27T06:19Z) for 87% of simulations.

The highest Kp=8 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2023-04-23T18:00Z-21:00Z and 2023-04-24T03:00Z-06:00Z (see notifications 20230423-AL-011 and 20230424-AL-001). This severe geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-04-23T17:00Z of the O-type CME mentioned above first visible at 2023-04-21T18:12Z (see notification 20230423-AL-006). This arrival also caused a strong compression of the magnetosphere. Simulations carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-04-23T19:15Z (see notifications 20230423-AL-008 and 20230423-AL-009). The arrival of this CME was also detected by the STEREO A IMPACT and PLASTIC data around 2023-04-23T14:00Z.\n\nThere was also a solar energetic particle event detected by STEREO A, SOHO, and GOES. The flux of 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-04-23T13:58Z. The flux of one or more of the SOHO >15.8 MeV protons channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-04-23T17:28Z. The flux of GOES > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2023-04-23T18:15Z (see notifications 20230423-AL-002, 20230423-AL-003, 20230423-AL-005, 20230423-AL-007, and 20230423-AL-010). This solar energetic particle event was associated with the arrival of the O-type CME mentioned above. The particle environment was somewhat elevated close to the end of 2023-04-21 with the eruption of the CME, but it crossed the different thresholds on the CME arrival time. The particle environment is back to nominal levels in all the locations. \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the solar energetic particle event mentioned above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-04-21  17:44:00  18:44:00  18:12:00   M1.7   S21W12 ( 13283 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-04-21T18:12Z     ~1204           O                19/-13               43                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-24T14:12Z     ~583            C                 5/-38               44                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-04-19T16:12Z     ~656            C            NONE (POS)/-15           17                          SOHO\n2023-04-20T15:48Z     ~681            C                90/71                25                          SOHO                              \n2023-04-21T06:24Z     ~804            C                99/-8                23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-25T20:48Z     ~875            C                20/-41               23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n                   \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-04-26T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-05-02T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low to moderate during the upcoming period. There are seven active regions present on the Earth's facing disk. The active regions 13288 (S22E13) and 13289 (N20E56) have currently been producing most of the C and B-class flaring activity and may continue to produce some activity in the next upcoming period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be moderate for the upcoming week due to the expected arrival on 2023-04-27 of the C-type CME mentioned above and also the possible arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream at the end of 2023-04-26. Currently, GOES \"greater than 2.0 MeV\" integral electron flux was above the threshold of 1000 pfu starting at 2023-04-26T12:35Z.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO A between about 2023-04-26T21:23Z and 2023-04-27T05:54Z (average arrival 2023-04-27T02:16Z) for 83% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-04-27T01:06Z and 2023-04-27T11:02Z (average arrival 2023-04-27T06:19Z) for 87% of simulations.

The highest value of Kp=4.33 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-04-18T15:00Z-18:00Z. This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of an interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-04-18T13:19Z (see notification 20230418-AL-001) which may be associated with the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-04-14T21:24Z. Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-04-18T17:59Z (see notifications 20230418-AL-002 and 20230418-AL-003). \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-04-14  16:10:00  16:25:00  16:18:00   M1.1   N11E57 ( 13282 ) \n2023-04-14  23:18:00  23:31:00  23:27:00   M1.5   N11E54 ( 13282 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-04-12T04:12Z     ~560            C                60/-44               42                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-14T21:24Z     ~529            C                 8/-24               18                          SOHO                              \n2023-04-15T17:12Z     ~1076           O                28/-72               13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-15T23:24Z     ~784            C               107/-39               28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-16T00:00Z     ~623            C               115/-38               31                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-04-16T20:36Z     ~656            C               -85/-34               27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-04-19T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-04-25T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently eight numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13282 (N11W10) produced both M-class flares observed during the reporting period. This region may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity during the outlook period. Additionally, an unnumbered Active Region visible on the eastern limb in STEREO A EUVI imagery near latitude S20 is expected to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2023-04-20.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be minor to moderate during the outlook period. The interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-04-18T13:19Z, possibly associated with the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-04-14T21:24Z (see notification 20230418-AL-001), may cause enhancement in the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt during the first half of the outlook period.  Additionally, the combined arrival of S-type CMEs first seen in STEREO A COR2 at 2023-04-16T00:24Z and SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-04-16T00:36Z may impact missions near Earth around 2023-04-20T10:56Z. The expected Kp range is 2-4 (low to below minor). Furthermore, there were two broad coronal dimming signatures seen near the central meridian centered around latitudes N22 and S03 at 2023-04-17T05:00Z and 2023-04-17T12:30Z, respectively, that did not appear to have created any detectable CMEs in available coronagraph imagery due to their location on the solar disk, but appear to be Earth-directed. It is possible we may see these arrival signatures at L1 in the beginning of the outlook period. Finally, there may be minor enhancement in geomagnetic activity in the second half of the outlook period due to the possible arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream associated with a coronal hole which reached the central meridian on 2023-04-18. \n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"MPC","messageID":"20230418-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/24692/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-04-18T17:55Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Magnetopause Crossing\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-04-18T17:55:33Z\n## Message ID: 20230418-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

These elevated energetic electron flux levels were likely caused by the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-03-30. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux levels returned to background levels on 2023-04-10. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-04-06  05:36:00  06:04:00  05:53:00   M3.0   S22E89 ( 13272 ) \n2023-04-08  01:38:00  01:50:00  01:46:00   M2.9   S20E60 ( 13272 ) \n2023-04-10  05:10:00  05:28:00  05:20:00   M2.8   S22E85 ( 13276 ) \n2023-04-11  09:51:00  10:23:00  10:16:00   M1.3   S19E17 ( 13272 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-04-05T23:09Z     ~634            C              -151/-17               20                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-04-06T01:36Z     ~704            C              -151/-10               15                          SOHO                              \n2023-04-06T03:24Z     ~507            C              -151/-11               28                          SOHO                              \n2023-04-06T06:48Z     ~518            C              -151/-14               21                          SOHO                              \n2023-04-06T09:36Z     ~758            C              -151/-14               19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-06T20:36Z     ~539            C              -127/-31               24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-06T22:00Z     ~516            C              -127/-24               37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-06T23:24Z     ~579            C              -127/-27               25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-07T00:24Z     ~717            C              -127/-26               28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-07T07:12Z     ~533            C              -127/-30               31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-07T11:48Z     ~621            C                15/-42               22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-07T12:38Z     ~564            C              -129/-15               35                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-04-08T07:48Z     ~546            C              -151/57                23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-09T06:09Z     ~706            C                43/-17               26                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-04-09T08:36Z     ~538            C               160/-28               28                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-09T09:48Z     ~655            C                76/16                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-09T19:48Z     ~524            C                50/-34               31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-04-12T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-04-18T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels for the upcoming week. There are currently five numbered active regions on the Earth-facing disk and two decayed numbered plage regions. Most notable of these regions is Active Region 13272 (S21E02) which produced three of the four M-class flares during this reporting period and may continue to produce higher level flaring throughout the week. A region visible on the eastern limb of the STEREO A-facing disk near latitude S25 may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk in the first half of the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels throughout the upcoming week. Effects from the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-04-10 have begun to subside. This arrival was associated with the Interplanetary Shock detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2023-04-09T21:57Z (see notification 20230410-AL-001). The arrival of this coronal hole high speed stream may have been combined with a weak transient event, and also was possibly detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments on 2023-04-09. The >2.0 energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt may be enhanced during the outlook period due to the arrival of the aforementioned coronal hole high speed stream. Finally, there may be additional increases in geomagnetic activity during the outlook period from a coronal hole currently centered around S40W15 that may become geoeffective around 2023-04-14 and a coronal hole currently centered around N30W03 which may become geoeffective around 2023-04-15.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230412-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/24614/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-04-12T19:29Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-REx, Solar Orbiter, Parker Solar Probe)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-04-12T19:29:35Z\n## Message ID: 20230412-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp=4.67 occurred during the synoptic period of 2023-03-31T03:00Z-06:00Z. This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream observed at DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-03-30.  \n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was enhanced at the beginning of this reporting period due to a threshold crossing during the previous reporting period beginning at 2023-03-27T00:25Z, caused by a coronal hole high speed stream which arrived on 2023-03-24 (see notifications 20230327-AL-001, 20230327-AL-002, and 20230329-AL-003). Energetic electron flux levels subsided on 2023-03-30 before a new threshold crossing of 1000 pfu occurred at 2023-03-31T18:15Z (see notifications 20230331-AL-001, 20230403-AL-001 and 20230405-AL-001). This separate elevation in energetic electron flux levels were likely caused by the arrival of a new coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-03-30. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux levels remained elevated above 1000 pfu for the rest of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. The GOES >10 MeV protons were elevated above the background on 2023-03-30, possibly in association with an M5.4-class solar flare from AR 13256 located at S22W77 which peaked around 2023-03-30T07:24Z and associated C-type CME that was first visible in SOHO imagery at 2023-03-30T08:00Z.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-03-29  02:18:00  02:40:00  02:33:00   X1.2   S22W60 ( 13256 ) \n2023-03-29  13:47:00  14:15:00  14:07:00   M1.2   S22W69 ( 13256 ) \n2023-03-29  23:35:00  23:58:00  23:47:00   M1.1   S21W72 ( 13256 ) \n2023-03-30  07:24:00  07:43:00  07:37:00   M5.4   S22W77 ( 13256 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s)\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-03-30T08:00Z     ~520            C                78/-12               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-31T14:57Z     ~819            C               119/35                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-31T17:53Z     ~548            C               104/26                41                          STEREO A                          \n2023-04-01T03:36Z     ~989            C                87/-23               50                          SOHO                              \n2023-04-01T04:36Z     ~1011           O               -54/-74               24                          SOHO                              \n2023-04-01T12:53Z     ~683            C               172/11                45                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-04-01T13:48Z     ~553            C              -149/-1                29                          SOHO                              \n2023-04-02T12:24Z     ~565            C              -136/-11               12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-03T04:00Z     ~865            C               -44/-40               19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-03T08:00Z     ~522            C               151/32                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-04T03:48Z     ~544            C                87/16                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-04T04:12Z     ~572            C               102/28                12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-04-04T05:36Z     ~580            C                26/-49               19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-04-05T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-04-11T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary from low to moderate levels in the outlook period. There are currently three numbered Active Regions and four decayed plage regions on the Earth-facing disk. The most complex of these Active Regions, AR 13270 (S23W41), has a beta-gamma magnetic configuration and may exhibit notable flaring activity during the outlook period. An unnumbered active region seen in STEREO A EUVI imagery near latitude S30 may soon rotate onto the Earth-facing disk in the first half of the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at low to minor levels during the outlook period. A small coronal hole centered around N10E45 is expected to cross the central meridian by 2023-04-08. The >2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt most recently crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-03-31T18:15Z as mentioned above and is likely to remain elevated during the beginning part of the outlook period. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20230405-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/24509/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-04-05T12:51Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-04-05T12:51:07Z\n## Message ID: 20230405-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
