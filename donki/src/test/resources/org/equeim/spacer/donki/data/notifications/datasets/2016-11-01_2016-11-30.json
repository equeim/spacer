The active regions on the solar surface appear to have low magnetic complexity.  The geomagnetic activity was slightly elevated on 2016-11-22 due to the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 (speeds only reached values of 526 km/s on 2016-11-26).

The highest Kp value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2016-11-11T00:00Z-03:00Z.  This minor increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the combination of an arrival detected by DSCOVR at L1 on 2016-11-09T05:28Z of a coronal mass ejection that started on the Sun on 2016-11-05T04:48Z, and a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2016-11-10.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^5 pfu starting at 2016-11-13T13:10Z.  These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt measured by GOES 13 were associated with the coronal hole high speed stream described above (see notifications 20161113-AL-001 and 20161113-AL-002).  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the enhanced electron fluxes on the outer radiation belt described above.  \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-11-09T01:25Z     ~724            C               -49/23                27                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2016-11-16T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2016-11-22T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week.

This increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR at L1 around 2016-10-25 (see notification 20161026-AL-003).
