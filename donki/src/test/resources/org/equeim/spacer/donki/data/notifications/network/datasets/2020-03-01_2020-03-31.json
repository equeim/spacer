There were no significant flares or CMEs.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic period of 2020-03-19T00:00Z-03:00Z.  This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 around 2020-03-17.  Solar wind speed reached values of >500 km/s on 2020-03-19.   \n\nThe >2 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 10^3 pfu starting at 2020-03-23T15:45Z. These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were elevated due to a possible combination of the coronal hole high speed stream described above and several small coronal holes high speed stream arrivals on 2020-03-21 and 2020-03-23, respectively. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the significantly elevated electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-03-25T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-03-31T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.
