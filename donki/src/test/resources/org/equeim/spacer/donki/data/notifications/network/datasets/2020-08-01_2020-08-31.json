There was 1 C-type CME (see details below). Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that this C-type CME starting around 2020-08-16T18:24Z may have a glancing blow at Parker Solar Probe at 2020-08-19T04:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20200817-AL-001). \n\nBased on additional heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that this C-type CME may also impact STEREO A and missions near Earth. For 48 ensemble members, simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO A between about 2020-08-19T04:12Z and 2020-08-19T06:26Z (average arrival 2020-08-19T05:05Z) for 16% of simulations, and also NASA missions near Earth between about 2020-08-19T10:55Z and 2020-08-20T00:51Z (average arrival 2020-08-19T18:30Z) for 100% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 79% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 2-4 range (below minor to below minor) (see notification 20200817-AL-002).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=3 for the reporting period.  The highest value of Kp=3 occurred during the synoptic period of 2020-08-18T21:00Z-24:00Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was briefly elevated above the threshold level of 1000 pfu at the beginning of the reporting period due to the high speed stream starting at 2020-08-02T04:30Z. This enhancement gradually subsided and returned to background levels by the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to minor this week due to the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt towards the beginning of the reporting period described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2020-08-16T18:24Z     ~541            C               -25/-8                29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-08-19T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-08-25T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be at low to moderate levels for the upcoming week.

There were no significant flares or CMEs.        \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with the Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=2 for the reporting period.

These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with a coronal hole high speed stream starting on 2020-08-02.  \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-08-12T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-08-18T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week. Several small active regions are currently visible on the solar surface as seen in the available imagery. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt remains slightly elevated although below the threshold of 1000 pfu after being elevated throughout the reporting period. Geomagnetic activity is expected to be low to moderate for the upcoming week due to the diminishing enhancement of the electron flux above and a possible disturbance on or after 2020-08-14 due to the arrival of a minor diffuse coronal hole high speed stream.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2020-08-02.\n \nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was slightly enhanced above background levels on 2020-08-04 due to the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream described above. However, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period.\n \nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period.\n \nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n \n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location        \nNone Observed\n \nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n \nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time) \nNone Observed\n \nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time) \nNone Observed\n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-08-05T00:00Z\n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-08-11T23:59Z\n \nThe solar activity is expected to be at low levels for the upcoming week. There are three active regions currently visible on the solar surface as seen in the available imagery. A continual enhancement in the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES may be observed towards the beginning of the upcoming week. Currently, the integral electron flux is above the 1000 pfu threshold starting at 2020-08-05T08:15Z (see notification 20200805-AL-001).
