There was 1 C-type CME (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2017-11-25T00:00Z-03:00Z and 2017-11-28T00:00Z-03:00Z. The second slight enhancement in the geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a small coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 on 2017-11-27.  The solar wind speed reached values of ~490 km/s on 2017-11-27.\n\nSTEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments detected the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-11-24 with the solar wind speed reaching values of >600 km/s. \n\n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been very low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-11-23T07:48Z     ~505            C               -90/30                13                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-11-29T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-12-05T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be very low for the upcoming week.

The highest values of Kp=6 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2017-11-07T18:00 to 2017-11-08T06:00Z.  This increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 around 2017-11-07 (see notifications 20171107-AL-001 and 20171107-AL-002).

There are a couple of active regions present on the far side of the Sun as seen from the STEREO A EUVI images that can potentially produce some solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  Geomagnetic activity is expected to be elevated for the next few days due to the coronal hole high speed stream described above.  Currently, the solar wind speed detected by DSCOVR/ACE at L1 reached values of >650 km/s.   \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
