There were 7 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-03-24T22:12Z  Parker Solar Probe at 2023-03-25T21:00Z (see notification 20230325-AL-001)\n2023-03-27T07:36Z  Parker Solar Probe at 2023-03-28T10:00Z (see notification 20230327-AL-003)\n2023-03-27T23:48Z  Parker Solar Probe at 2023-03-29T04:02Z (see notification 20230328-AL-001)\n\nGeomagnetic activity reached severe storm levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=7.67 during the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=7.67 occurred during the synoptic period of 2023-03-24T03:00Z-06:00Z (see notifications 20230323-AL-004, 20230323-AL-005, and 20230324-AL-001). The significant enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock observed by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-03-23T09:10Z (see notification 20230323-AL-001) which was likely caused by the combined arrival of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-03-20T14:42Z (see notifications 20230320-AL-002, 20230322-AL-001) and possibly the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-03-20T02:41Z (notification 20230320-AL-001).  Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-03-23T14:52Z (see notifications 20230323-AL-002 and 20230323-AL-003). The arrival of the CME first seen at 2023-03-20T14:42Z may have also been observed at STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC on 2023-03-23T04:00Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2023-03-27T00:25Z and remained elevated throughout the reporting period (see notifications 20230327-AL-001, 20230327-AL-002 and 20230329-AL-003). The elevated energetic electron flux levels were caused by the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream at L1 starting on 2023-03-24 and the preceding significant CME arrival described above. The solar wind reached a maximum sustained speed of roughly 600 km/s on 2023-03-26.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons at GOES, the >15.8 MeV protons at SOHO and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all below their respective threshold levels throughout the reporting period. At the start of the reporting period all proton fluxes were still slightly elevated above background levels - likely a legacy of the solar energetic particle event on 2023-03-13 associated with the backside halo R-type CME first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-03-13T03:36Z - but went down to background levels in the first half of the reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed  \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-03-22T07:24Z     ~560            C              -107/6                 32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-22T08:00Z     ~587            C               -93/8                 19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-24T22:12Z     ~542            C               112/28                34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-26T05:24Z     ~518            C               -35/-34               18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-27T07:36Z     ~561            C               119/-23               20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-27T14:24Z     ~757            C                68/-38               13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-27T23:48Z     ~567            C               100/25                37                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-03-29T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-04-04T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary from minor to high levels in the outlook period. There are currently seven numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. The most complex of these, Active Region 13256 (S22W72) has produced an X1.2 flare (see notifications 20230329-AL-001 and 20230329-AL-002) and an M1.2 flare today, along with multiple C-class flares. It will be rotating off the Earth-facing disk on 2023-03-31 but might remain a source of major flaring in the beginning of the outlook period. Two unnumbered active regions may soon start rotating onto the eastern limb in STEREO A EUVI imagery (near latitudes S30 and and N20) and could rotate onto the Earth-facing disk in the first half of the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt most recently crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-03-29T02:00Z (see notification 20230329-AL-003) and is likely to remain elevated during the beginning part of the outlook period. There may be additional increases in geomagnetic activity during the outlook period from the equatorial coronal hole currently centered around S00W15 that may become geoeffective on or after 2023-03-31. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20230329-AL-003","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/24416/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-03-29T18:45Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Continued Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-03-29T18:45:27Z\n## Message ID: 20230329-AL-003\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

A single CME ensemble was created for this event with 24 ensemble members. For the ensemble, the CME was estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-03-23T06:12Z and 2023-03-23T18:23Z (average arrival 2023-03-23T11:20Z) for 87% of simulations (see notification 20230322-AL-001 and full details at https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-03-21_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA024/Detailed_results_20230320_185400_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA024.txt).\n\nAdditionally, it was estimated that the C-type CME first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-03-20T14:42Z would impact NASA missions near Earth at 2023-03-23T17:44Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 3-5 (below minor to minor) (see notification 20230320-AL-002).\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs would impact other locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-03-17T22:24Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-03-21T16:11Z (see notification 20230318-AL-001)\n2023-03-20T02:41Z   STEREO A at 2023-03-23T12:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230320-AL-001)\n2023-03-20T14:42Z   Mars at 2023-03-25T22:16Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-03-21T22:07Z, STEREO A at 2023-03-23T11:42Z, Lucy at 2023-03-25T23:00Z (see notification 20230320-AL-002)\n2023-03-21T13:09Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-03-22T00:00Z\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index <= 5.67 for the reporting period.

This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with an interplanetary shock observed at DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-03-15T03:48Z (see notification 20230315-AL-001) and was likely associated with the arrival of the C-type CME from the previous reporting period first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-03-12T19:24Z and possibly a coronal hole high speed stream on 2023-03-15. This CME arrival may also have been observed at STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data on 2023-03-15T08:25Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES was elevated above the threshold of 10 pfu during the beginning of the reporting period due to the sustained enhancement during the previous reporting period on 2023-03-13 caused by the backsided halo R-type CME first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-03-13T03:36Z. The energetic proton flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A was elevated starting on 2023-03-13. The energetic proton fluxes observed at GOES and STEREO A began declining to background levels on 2023-03-15 but remained elevated throughout the reporting period.\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevation in the energetic proton fluxes described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-03-17  15:04:00  15:11:00  15:07:00   M1.0   S22W65 ( 13247 ) \n2023-03-20  01:19:00  02:26:00  01:48:00   M1.2   S22E53 ( 13256 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-03-20T02:41Z     ~550            C                20/-31               28                          SOHO                              \n2023-03-20T14:42Z     ~749            C               -40/27                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-03-15T06:48Z     ~745            C         NONE(POS)/-25               19                          SOHO  \n2023-03-15T08:12Z     ~663            C              -109/18                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-16T21:12Z     ~606            C                35/-51               31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-17T08:03Z     ~1017           O               -85/-30               12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-17T10:30Z     ~623            C                85/-48               32                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-17T13:32Z     ~523            C              -110/-3                36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-17T22:24Z     ~762            C                90/-31               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-19T18:40Z     ~571            C               -49/-28               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-20T14:14Z     ~779            C               151/-27               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-21T13:09Z     ~608            C               107/-14               20                          STEREO A                          \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-03-22T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-03-28T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently five numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13247 produced one M-class flare on 2023-03-17 before rotating off of the Earth-facing disk on 2023-03-18. Additionally, at least two unnumbered active regions observed towards the eastern limb in STEREO A EUVI imagery near latitudes S25 and and N20 may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2023-03-23.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor to moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There may be some minor enhancement in the geomagnetic activity due to the arrival of the two C-type CMEs first mentioned above predicted to impact NASA missions near Earth around 2023-03-23. There may be additional increases in geomagnetic activity during the outlook period from the coronal hole currently centered around S40W05 that may become geoeffective around 2023-03-25. The > 2.0 MeV elevated energetic electron flux may be enhanced due to an ongoing coronal hole high speed stream first detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-03-21.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230322-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/24343/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-03-22T13:05Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (ensemble) (Mars, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, Lucy, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-03-22T13:05:52Z\n## Message ID: 20230322-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A and Mars. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-03-23T04:18Z and 2023-03-23T14:26Z (average arrival 2023-03-23T08:08Z) for 100% of simulations.\n- Mars between about 2023-03-25T15:53Z and 2023-03-26T06:30Z (average arrival 2023-03-26T01:27Z) for 91% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-03-23T06:12Z and 2023-03-23T18:23Z (average arrival 2023-03-23T11:20Z) for 87% of simulations.

For the ensemble, the CME was estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-03-14T23:20Z and 2023-03-15T15:49Z (average arrival 2023-03-15T08:55Z) for 70% of simulations (see notification 20230314-AL-003 and full details at https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-03-13_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA022/Detailed_results_20230312_192400_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA022.txt). The arrival of this CME was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-03-15T03:48Z (see notification 20230315-AL-001). The STEREO A PLASTIC/IMPACT instruments may have also detected the arrival of this CME around 2023-03-15T08:25Z.\n\nIt was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-03-13T10:53Z would impact NASA missions near Earth as a glancing blow at about 2023-03-16T08:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index is 3-4 (low to below minor) (see notification 20230313-AL-005).\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs would impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-03-09T23:12Z   Juno at 2023-03-29T12:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230310-AL-001)\n2023-03-10T13:36Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-03-14T10:37Z\n2023-03-10T17:24Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-03-15T06:23Z, STEREO A at 2023-03-14T08:00Z (glancing blow) (see notifications 20230311-AL-001 and 20230312-AL-001)\n2023-03-12T04:00Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-03-13T00:00Z (glancing blow), Mars at 2023-03-17T05:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230312-AL-002)\n2023-03-12T19:24Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-03-14T11:00Z (glancing blow), STEREO A at 2023-03-15T15:00Z (glancing blow) (see notifications 20230313-AL-006 and 20230314-AL-003)\n2023-03-13T03:36Z   Parker Solar Probe at 2023-03-13T08:00Z, Juno at 2023-03-22T08:51Z (see notifications 20230313-AL-003, 20230313-AL-004, and 20230313-AL-007)\n2023-03-13T10:53Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-03-18T10:00Z (minor impact) (see notification 20230313-AL-005)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4.33 for the reporting period.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was enhanced above the 1000 pfu threshold during the beginning of the reporting period due to a sustained enhancement observed during the previous reporting period, caused by the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-03-02 (see notifications 20230307-AL-001 and 20230309-AL-001). Energetic electron flux levels dropped below the threshold of 1000 pfu on 2023-03-11 and continued to subside towards background levels during the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nA solar energetic particle event was detected by GOES and SOHO. At GOES, the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2023-03-13T07:45Z, crossing the threshold again at 2023-03-13T14:05Z, 2023-03-13T16:20Z, and 2023-03-14T11:55Z (see notifications 20230313-AL-001, 20230313-AL-002, 20230314-AL-001, and 20230314-AL-002). At SOHO, the flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV proton channels exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-03-13T20:26Z (see notification 20230313-AL-008). The energetic proton flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected at STEREO A were elevated starting on 2023-03-13, but remained below the 10^(-1) pfu/MeV threshold for the entire reporting period. These observed solar energetic particles are associated with the far-sided R-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-03-13T03:36Z (see notifications 20230313-AL-003, 20230313-AL-004, and 20230313-AL-007). Further enhancement of the particle environment may have been caused by the arrival of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-03-10T17:24Z mentioned above.\n\n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the energetic electron and solar energetic particle environments described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-03-08  09:53:00  10:46:00  10:12:00   M1.1   N09W07 ( 13242 ) \n2023-03-08  22:35:00  22:52:00  22:44:00   M1.3   S23E11 ( 13245 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-03-10T17:24Z     ~515            C                38/-30               46                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-12T19:24Z     ~793            C                -3/-38               27                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-13T10:53Z     ~750            C                31/31                39                          STEREO A                          \n\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-03-08T16:48Z     ~1062           O               -76/33                13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-08T20:12Z     ~749            C                73/60                10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-08T22:12Z     ~955            C               155/-39               20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-09T13:25Z     ~1382           O               160/17                52                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-09T13:48Z     ~1559           O               168/-4                45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-09T20:12Z     ~1248           O               168/-47               33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-09T20:53Z     ~1142           O               136/-43               25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-09T23:12Z     ~944            C              -158/-17               34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-09T23:48Z     ~1170           O               -66/26                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-10T13:36Z     ~654            C                70/-3                30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-11T12:36Z     ~694            C               155/-26               18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-11T16:48Z     ~639            C                46/-54               35                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-12T04:00Z     ~673            C              -107/31                48                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-12T22:09Z     ~663            C         NONE(POS)/30                27                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-03-13T03:36Z     ~2127           R              -160/16                50                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-13T19:48Z     ~610            C                90/-5                23                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-14T02:12Z     ~539            C         NONE(POS)/-6                10                          SOHO                              \n2023-03-14T17:00Z     ~557            C               156/71                24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-14T18:38Z     ~609            C               131/-10               32                          STEREO A, SOHO                     \n2023-03-14T22:12Z     ~506            C               107/2                 19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-03-15T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-03-21T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently many numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Regions 13242 and 13245 produced lower-level M-class flares on 2023-03-08; while Active Region 13242 rotated off of the Earth-facing disk on 2023-03-14, Active Region 13245 is expected to rotate off the Earth-facing disk on 2023-03-16. A large unnumbered active region currently visible towards the eastern limb in both SDO/AIA and STEREO A EUV imagery near latitude N25 is beginning to rotate onto the Earth-facing disk. Additionally, an unnumbered active region observed towards the eastern limb of STEREO A EUV imagery near latitude S25 may rotate onto the Earth-facing disk by 2023-03-17. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. The arrival of the C-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-03-12T19:24Z was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 at 2023-03-15T03:48Z (see notification 20230315-AL-001). This arrival caused an enhancement in geomagnetic activity with an associated Kp index value of 5.67 observed during the synoptic period of 2023-03-15T03:00Z-06:00Z. Towards the latter part of the outlook period on or around 2023-03-20, a small coronal hole currently centered near S16E15 on the Earth-facing disk may reach geoeffective longitudes.\n\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"IPS","messageID":"20230315-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/24245/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-03-15T12:21Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Interplanetary Shock\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-03-15T12:21:17Z\n## Message ID: 20230315-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-03-14T22:26Z and 2023-03-15T14:16Z (average arrival 2023-03-15T08:23Z) for 66% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-03-14T23:20Z and 2023-03-15T15:49Z (average arrival 2023-03-15T08:55Z) for 70% of simulations.

The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 59% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-4 range (below minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-03-11_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021/20230310_231100_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-03-11_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021/20230310_231100_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-03-11_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021/20230310_231100_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-03-11_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021/20230310_231100_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021_probabilistic_Kp_forecast_wdist.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-03-11_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021/20230310_231100_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-03-11_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021/20230310_231100_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nThis CME event (2023-03-10T17:24:00-CME-001) is also predicted to have an impact at OSIRIS-REx at 2023-03-15T06:23Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 2023-03-11T13:49:18Z).\n\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-03-11_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021/Detailed_results_20230310_231100_ncmes1_sims32_LAHAINA021.txt\n###\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230311-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/24189/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-03-11T13:49Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (OSIRIS-REx, STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-03-11T13:49:18Z\n## Message ID: 20230311-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

There was 1 O-type CME and 8 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the following CMEs are predicted to impact non-Earth locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-03-03T18:12Z  OSIRIS-REx at 2023-03-07T04:40Z (see notification 20230303-AL-004)\n2023-03-04T07:36Z  OSIRIS-REx at 2023-03-07T17:00Z (minor impact) (see notifications 20230304-AL-001)\n2023-03-04T15:48Z  OSIRIS-REx at 2023-03-07T22:18Z (see notifications 20230304-AL-004, 20230304-AL-005)\n2023-03-06T03:12Z  OSIRIS-REx at 2023-03-08T20:28Z (see notifications 20230306-AL-004)\n2023-03-07T20:53Z  OSIRIS-REx at 2023-03-11T08:00Z (minor impact) (see notification 20230308-AL-001)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4.33 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 4.33 occurred during synoptic periods 2023-03-03T18:00Z to 2023-03-04T00:00Z. This slight enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the combined arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-03-02 and an interplanetary shock detected by DSCOVR at L1 on 2023-03-02T21:55Z which may be associated with a CME initially observed during the previous reporting period by SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-02-27T20:00Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was enhanced at the beginning of this reporting period due to a threshold crossing during the previous reporting period beginning at 2023-02-28T21:55Z, caused by the combined arrivals of the CME with ID 2023-02-24T20:36:00-CME-001, the CME with ID 2023-02-25T19:38:00-CME-001, and a coronal hole high speed stream observed at L1 on 2023-02-26 (see notifications 20230228-AL-003, 20230301-AL-001, 20230303-AL-001, and 20230305-AL-001). Energetic electron flux levels were further enhanced on 2022-03-05, crossing the threshold level of 1000 pfu again at 2023-03-05T05:05Z (see notification 20230307-AL-001). These elevated energetic electron flux levels were likely associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-03-02. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux levels were above the 1000 pfu threshold through the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the radiation belt enhancement described above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-03-01  00:56:00  01:18:00  01:07:00   M1.0   N26W33 ( 13234 ) \n2023-03-02  21:05:00  21:25:00  21:16:00   M3.8   N20W65 ( 13234 ) \n2023-03-03  10:10:00  10:48:00  10:32:00   M3.2   N20W70 ( 13234 ) \n2023-03-03  17:42:00  17:59:00  17:52:00   X2.0   N20W75 ( 13234 ) \n2023-03-04  07:06:00  07:14:00  07:10:00   M1.0   N18W40 ( 13243 ) \n2023-03-04  13:34:00  13:47:00  13:42:00   M1.2   N10E45 ( 13242 ) \n2023-03-04  15:19:00  16:26:00  15:57:00   M5.2   N25W84 ( 13234 ) \n2023-03-05  02:40:00  03:03:00  02:52:00   M1.3   N22W90 ( 13234 ) \n2023-03-05  16:24:00  16:53:00  16:41:00   M1.0   N12E35 ( 13242 ) \n2023-03-05  16:53:00  17:11:00  17:01:00   M1.0   N13E35 ( 13242 ) \n2023-03-05  21:29:00  21:41:00  21:36:00   M5.0   N18W61 ( 13243 ) \n2023-03-06  02:08:00  02:35:00  02:28:00   M5.8   N18W65 ( 13243 ) \n2023-03-06  08:57:00  09:37:00  09:12:00   M1.3   N24W90 ( 13234 ) \n2023-03-06  17:24:00  18:10:00  17:50:00   M1.0   N14E24 ( 13242 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-03-01T14:12Z     ~653            C                56/-39               17                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-03T11:24Z     ~673            C                51/-51               29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-03T18:12Z     ~700            C                65/-2                36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-04T07:36Z     ~1576           O                48/-5                13                          SOHO                              \n2023-03-04T15:48Z     ~894            C                85/-2                45                          SOHO                              \n2023-03-06T03:12Z     ~970            C                65/-7                35                          SOHO                              \n2023-03-06T08:36Z     ~600            C               105/-41               42                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-07T14:48Z     ~638            C               117/-47               15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-03-07T20:53Z     ~803            C                75/39                40                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-03-08T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-03-14T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently twelve numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13242 (located at N10W13) has a complex magnetic configuration and produced a few M-class flares towards the end of the reporting period. This region may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity during the outlook period.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was at moderate to high levels during this reporting period with 10 M-class flares, 1 O-type CME and 7 C-type CMEs (see details/list below). The M3.7 class flare peaking at 2023-02-24T20:30Z and the M6.3 class flare peaking at 2023-02-25T19:44Z originated from Active Region 13229 and were associated with the partial halo O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2023-02-24T20:36Z and the C-type CME first seen in STEREO A COR2 starting at 2023-02-25T19:38Z, respectively (see details below).\n\nBased on preliminary analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it was estimated that the O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-02-24T20:36Z would impact NASA missions near Earth at 2023-02-26T13:46Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 7-9 (strong to extreme) (see notification 20230224-AL-002). A single CME ensemble was created for this CME with 40 members. For the ensemble, the CME was estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between around 2023-02-26T06:28Z and 2023-02-26T22:27Z (average arrival 2023-02-26T14:03Z) for 100% of simulations (see notification 20230225-AL-008 and full details at https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-25_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019/Detailed_results_20230224_203600_ncmes1_sims40_LAHAINA019.txt). The arrival of this CME was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-02-26T18:43Z (see notification 20230226-AL-004). The STEREO A IMPACT instrument may have also detected the arrival of this CME around 2023-02-26T14:30Z.\n\nAdditionally, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in STEREO A COR2 starting at 2023-02-25T19:38Z would impact NASA missions near Earth at 2023-02-27T21:58Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 5-7 (minor to strong) (see notifications 20230225-AL-009, 20230226-AL-001, and 20230226-AL-003). A single CME ensemble was created for this CME with 24 members. For the ensemble, the CME was estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-02-27T10:30Z and 2023-02-28T00:55Z (average arrival 2023-02-27T18:10Z) for 79% of simulations (see notification 20230226-AL-007 and full details at https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-02-26_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020/Detailed_results_20230225_224600_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA020.txt). The arrival of this CME was detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-02-27T10:15Z (see notification 20230227-AL-003). The STEREO A IMPACT instrument may have detected this arrival after a data gap around 2023-02-27T00:00Z.\n\nSTEREO A IMPACT may have detected the arrival of the CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-02-22T14:36Z around 2023-02-25T10:00Z. This CME was predicted to impact missions near Earth as a glancing blow at 2023-02-25T22:00Z with a maximum Kp index 2-4 (below minor), Mars at 2023-02-28T08:00Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-02-24T18:42Z, Lucy at 2023-02-27T14:00Z (glancing blow), and STEREO A at 2023-02-25T11:00Z.\n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs would impact other locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-02-24T14:00Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-02-26T22:03Z, Mars at 2023-03-02T00:00Z (minor impact)\n2023-02-24T20:36Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-02-28T16:00Z (glancing blow), Solar Orbiter at 2023-02-27T03:00Z (glancing blow), STEREO A at 2023-02-26T17:38Z (see notification 20230224-AL-002).\n2023-02-25T19:38Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-03-01T01:25Z, Solar Orbiter at 2023-02-27T06:00Z (minor impact), STEREO A at 2023-02-28T06:00Z (minor impact) (see notifications 20230225-AL- 009, 20230226-AL-001, and 20230226-AL-003).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at strong storm levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=7 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp = 7 occurred during the synoptic period of 2023-02-27T09:00Z-12:00Z  (see notifications 20230227-AL-001, 20230227-AL-002, and 2023-02-27-AL-004). This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was associated with the combined arrivals of the O-type CME first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2023-02-24T20:36Z, the C-type CME first observed in STEREO A COR2 at 2023-02-25T19:38Z, and the coronal hole high speed stream effects first observed at L1 possibly on 2023-02-26. Strong compression of the magnetosphere was detected following this arrival. Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-02-26T21:26Z (see notifications 20230226-AL-005 and 20230226-AL-006).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES briefly crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu starting at 2023-02-23T19:30Z. These energetic electron flux levels were caused by a coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2023-02-22 (see notifications 20230223-AL-001 and 20230223-AL-002). The energetic electron flux levels crossed the threshold again at 2023-02-28T21:55Z due to the combined arrivals of the CMEs and coronal hole high speed stream mentioned above (see notifications 20230228-AL-003 and 20230301-AL-001). The solar wind speed observed at L1 reached a maximum sustained speed of approximately 820 km/s.\n\nThe flux of 13-100 MeV protons detected by STEREO A exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-02-25T20:41Z (see notifications 20230225-AL-004 and 20230225-AL-005). Additionally, the flux of > 10 MeV protons detected by GOES exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2023-02-25T21:10Z (see notifications 20230225-AL-006, and 20230225-AL-007) and the observed flux of one or more of the >15.8 MeV and >28.2 protons channels detected by SOHO exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-02-25T21:56Z (see notification 20230225-AL-010). The particle environment was first elevated due to the M3.7 class flare peaking at 2023-02-24T20:30Z and the associated partial halo O-type CME. The environment was then further enhanced with the M6.3-class flare from Active Region 13229 that peaked at 2023-02-25T19:44Z and the associated C-type CME causing this solar energetic particle event (see notifications 20230225-AL-001, 20230225-AL-002, 20230225-AL-009, 20230226-AL-001, and 20230226-AL-003).   \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate to high this week due to the solar energetic particle events and radiation belt enhancement described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-02-22  04:51:00  05:40:00  05:12:00   M1.4   N27E59 ( 13234 ) \n2023-02-22  13:36:00  13:58:00  13:50:00   M2.6   N26E53 ( 13234 ) \n2023-02-23  06:11:00  06:18:00  06:14:00   M1.5   N20E20 ( 13235 ) \n2023-02-23  08:32:00  08:51:00  08:48:00   M1.0   N25E42 ( 13234 ) \n2023-02-23  08:51:00  09:09:00  09:01:00   M1.2   N25E42 ( 13234 ) \n2023-02-24  17:11:00  17:20:00  17:15:00   M1.1   N20E01 ( 13235 ) \n2023-02-24  20:03:00  21:29:00  20:30:00   M3.7   N27W25 ( 13229 ) \n2023-02-25  15:35:00  15:46:00  15:40:00   M1.0   S28W04 ( 13236 ) \n2023-02-25  18:40:00  20:27:00  19:44:00   M6.3   N25W42 ( 13229 ) \n2023-02-28  17:35:00  17:56:00  17:50:00   M8.6   N28W30 ( 13234 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-02-22T14:36Z     ~524            C               -35/27                36                          SOHO, STEREO A  \n2023-02-24T20:36Z     ~1276           O                19/29                41                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-25T19:38Z     ~920            C                48/10                58                          SOHO, STEREO A                          \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)                     \n2023-02-24T13:25Z     ~928            C              -112/43                47                          SOHO                              \n2023-02-24T14:00Z     ~586            C               -68/20                41                          SOHO                              \n2023-02-24T16:48Z     ~706            C               -20/-39               13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-25T04:00Z     ~561            C              -122/27                19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-02-27T10:24Z     ~656            C               112/3                 16                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-03-01T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date: 2023-03-07T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate levels throughout the outlook period. There are currently six numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13234 (located at N28W36) has a beta-gamma-delta magnetic configuration and has recently produced an M8.6-class flare. It may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity during the beginning of the outlook period before the region rotates off the Earth-facing disk. The other active regions have low magnetic configuration.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to reach minor to moderate storm levels starting as early as 2023-03-05 due to the anticipated arrival of a high speed stream associated with a prominent, equatorial coronal hole which is located near the solar central meridian on 2023-03-01. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-02-28T21:55Z and may remain elevated throughout the outlook period (see notifications 20230228-AL-003 and 20230301-AL-001).\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20230301-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/24021/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-03-01T14:06Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-03-01T14:06:14Z\n## Message ID: 20230301-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts. This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSignificantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt. GOES \"greater than 2.0 MeV\" integral electron flux is above 1000 pfu starting at 2023-02-28T21:55Z. \n\nThe elevated energetic electron flux levels are caused by the combined arrivals of the CME with ID 2023-02-24T20:36:00-CME-001 (see notifications 20230224-AL-002 and 20230225-AL-008), the CME with ID 2023-02-25T19:38:00-CME-001 (see notifications 20230225-AL-009, 20230226-AL-001, 20230226-AL-003, and 20230226-AL-007), and a coronal hole high speed stream observed at L1 on 2023-02-26, which reached a maximum speed of approximately 820 km/s. The solar wind speed observed at L1 is currently around 600 km/s.\n\nThe arrival of the CME with ID 2023-02-24T20:36:00-CME-001 was detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-02-26T18:43Z (see notification 20230226-AL-004), and simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-02-26T21:26Z (see notifications 20230226-AL-005, 20230226-AL-006). \n\nThe arrival of the CME with ID 2023-02-25T19:38:00-CME-001 was detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-02-27T10:15Z (see notification 20230227-AL-003). Additionally, this CME arrival and the previously mentioned CME arrival are associated with a geomagnetic storm starting at 2023-02-27T03:00Z and ending at 2023-02-27T21:00Z, reaching a maximum Kp index level of 7 (strong) (see notifications 20230227-AL-001, 20230227-AL-002, and 20230227-AL-004).\n\nNASA spacecraft at GEO, MEO and other orbits passing through or in the vicinity of the Earth's outer radiation belt can be impacted.\n\nActivity ID: 2023-02-28T21:55:00-RBE-001. \n\n## Notes: \n\n\n\n"}]
