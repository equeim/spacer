The highest value of Kp = 5.67 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2023-09-24T18:00Z to 2023-09-25T00:00Z. This enhanced geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-09-24T19:52Z (see notification 20230924-AL-002) which was associated with a combined arrival of the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2023-09-22T02:24Z (see notifications 20230922-AL-002, 20230923-AL-001) and the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2023-09-22T07:36Z (see notifications 20230922-AL-001, 20230922-AL-002, 20230923-AL-001). Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-09-24T22:30Z (see notifications 20230924-AL-005 and 20230924-AL-006). The arrival of these CMEs were also detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data around 2023-09-24T18:49Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt remained elevated above the threshold of 1000 pfu through most of the reporting period following a threshold crossing observed during the previous reporting period at 2023-09-19T14:55Z (see notifications 20230919-AL-004, 20230919-AL-005. 20230921-AL-005, and 20230923-AL-002). These elevated energetic electron flux levels were likely associated with a possible combination arrival of an S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-09-14T23:12Z (see notification 20230915-AL-001), and/or the arrival of a C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-09-16T09:12Z (see notifications 20230916-AL-001, 20230916-AL-002, and 20230917-AL-001), and the possible arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream. Towards the end of the reporting period on 2023-09-24, the energetic electron flux levels dropped below the 1000 pfu threshold and remained below the threshold for the remainder of the reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A remained below threshold and at near-background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-09-20  14:11:00  14:25:00  14:19:00   M8.2   N07E35 ( 13435 ) \n2023-09-21  12:42:00  13:02:00  12:54:00   M8.7   N08E22 ( 13435 ) \n2023-09-22  02:25:00  06:56:00  03:36:00   M1.2   N15E17 ( 13435 ) \n2023-09-22  15:53:00  16:46:00  16:23:00   M1.4   N27W35 ( 13443 ) \n2023-09-22  17:06:00  17:20:00  17:15:00   M1.5   N28W40 ( 13443 ) \n2023-09-22  22:25:00  23:13:00  23:00:00   M1.9   N08E03 ( 13435 ) \n2023-09-23  20:14:00  21:00:00  20:43:00   M1.5   N20W90 ( 13436 ) \n2023-09-24  03:17:00  03:36:00  03:28:00   M4.4   S14E18 ( 13445 ) \n2023-09-24  14:51:00  15:05:00  15:00:00   M1.0   N28W58 ( 13443 ) \n\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-09-20T15:05Z     ~521            C               -35/-37               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-22T02:24Z     ~1026           O               -31/36                30                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-22T07:36Z     ~1508           O                 4/28                21                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-22T22:24Z     ~786            C                 2/-12               19                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-09-21T16:00Z     ~510            C              -100/31                49                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-21T21:12Z     ~760            C               -20/-42               25                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-22T09:12Z     ~584            C               -40/0                 10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-24T07:36Z     ~514            C               110/17                36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-24T10:00Z     ~1099           O               155/13                33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-24T16:24Z     ~619            C                90/4                 35                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-09-27T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-10-03T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently eight Active Regions across the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13435 (N09W61) produced five M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to produce notable flaring activity before it is expected to rotate off the Earth-facing disk towards the end of the outlook period. Active Region 13450 (S20E80) was recently numbered and may exhibit increased flaring activity during the outlook period.  \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. A coronal hole currently centered around N36E09 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective on or around 2023-10-01. An additional coronal hole currently centered around N05E40 could also become geoeffective towards the end of the reporting period on or around 2023-10-03. The >2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in Earths outer radiation belt recently crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu starting at 2023-09-27T12:00Z (see notifications  20230927-AL-001 and 20230927-AL-002). This ongoing radiation belt enhancement is associated with the combined arrival of the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2023-09-22T02:24Z (see notifications 20230922-AL-002, 20230923-AL-001) and the O-type CME first seen in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2023-09-22T07:36Z (see notifications 20230922-AL-001, 20230922-AL-002, 20230923-AL-001) which is likely to persist through the beginning of the outlook period.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"RBE","messageID":"20230927-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/27115/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-09-27T12:26Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - Radiation Belt Enhancement\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-09-27T12:26:20Z\n## Message ID: 20230927-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-09-23T19:06Z and 2023-09-24T09:50Z (average arrival 2023-09-24T02:18Z) for 100% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CMEs is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-09-23T21:04Z and 2023-09-24T12:33Z (average arrival 2023-09-24T04:50Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 95% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-09-22_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA047/20230922_060600_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA047_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-09-22_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA047/20230922_060600_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA047_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-09-22_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA047/20230922_060600_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA047_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-09-22_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA047/20230922_060600_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA047_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-09-22_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA047/20230922_060600_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA047_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\n\n- STEREO A between about 2023-09-23T16:18Z and 2023-09-23T22:30Z (average arrival 2023-09-23T19:49Z) for 29% of simulations.\n\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2023-09-23T17:58Z and 2023-09-23T22:30Z (average arrival 2023-09-23T20:52Z) for 20% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 100% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor).\n\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-09-20_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA046/20230920_150500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA046_anim_tim-den.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-09-20_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA046/20230920_150500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA046_arrival_Earth.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-09-20_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA046/20230920_150500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA046_Earth_stack.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-09-20_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA046/20230920_150500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA046_arrival_STA.gif\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-09-20_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA046/20230920_150500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA046_STA_stack.gif\n\n## Notes:\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\n\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-09-20_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA046/Detailed_results_20230920_150500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA046.txt\n###\n\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230921-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/27026/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-09-21T00:12Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (STEREO A, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-09-21T00:12:24Z\n## Message ID: 20230921-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The highest value of Kp=6.67 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-09-19T03:00Z-06:00Z. This enhanced geomagnetic activity was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-09-18T12:58Z (see notification 20230918-AL-001) which may have possibly been associated with a combination arrival of an S-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-09-14T23:12Z (see notification 20230915-AL-001), and/or the arrival of a C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery at 2023-09-16T09:12Z (see notifications 20230916-AL-001, 20230916-AL-002, and 20230917-AL-001), and the possible arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream. Analysis of this arrival signature is ongoing. Simulations indicated that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-09-18T17:54Z (see notifications 20230918-AL-002 and 20230918-AL-003). This interplanetary shock was also detected by STEREO A IMPACT/PLASTIC data around 2023-09-18T09:04Z.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu starting at 2023-09-19T14:55Z and remained elevated through the end of the reporting period (see notifications 20230919-AL-004 and 0230919-AL-005). These elevated energetic electron flux levels are likely associated with the possible arrival of the S-type and C-type CMEs described above and/or the possible arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A remained below threshold and at near-background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been minor to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above. \n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-09-14  06:40:00  08:39:00  07:45:00   M1.4   N25W50 ( 13429 ) \n2023-09-14  19:23:00  19:40:00  19:31:00   M1.9   N10E09 ( 13429 ) \n2023-09-14  21:17:00  21:32:00  21:26:00   M2.5   N10E06 ( 13429 ) \n2023-09-15  22:19:00  22:34:00  22:29:00   M1.7   N10W07 ( 13429 ) \n2023-09-16  00:38:00  00:57:00  00:50:00   M2.9   N11W09 ( 13429 ) \n2023-09-16  05:28:00  05:34:00  05:33:00   M2.5   N11E90 ( 13435 ) \n2023-09-16  05:34:00  06:15:00  05:38:00   M3.4   N11W12 ( 13429 ) \n2023-09-19  03:45:00  04:01:00  03:55:00   M1.1   N07E54 ( 13435 ) \n2023-09-19  09:23:00  09:44:00  09:38:00   M1.8   N07E50 ( 13435 ) \n2023-09-19  20:01:00  20:21:00  20:14:00   M4.0   N07E45 ( 13435 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-09-14T07:24Z     ~915            C                40/17                33                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-16T09:12Z     ~523            C                30/2                 45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-09-13T13:48Z     ~794            C         NONE(POS)/-17               15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-14T04:00Z     ~628            C               -52/-34               14                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-16T07:09Z     ~543            C              -148/31                31                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-09-17T13:38Z     ~663            C                90/-64               45                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-09-19T04:36Z     ~501            C               -54/-33               41                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-19T20:36Z     ~544            C               -45/-39               43                          SOHO                              \n\n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-09-20T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-09-26T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently ten numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13435 (N09E30) produced four M-class flares during the reporting period and is likely to exhibit additional flaring activity during the outlook period. Additionally, Active Region 13429 (N12W79) produced five M-class flares during the reporting period and could produce additional flaring activity as it rotates off the Earth-facing disk during the beginning of the outlook period. \n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Coronal hole structures currently centered around N00W20 and N40W00 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO) may become geoeffective on or around 2023-09-22 and 2023-09-23 respectively. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation is anticipated to remain elevated during the outlook period, having most recently crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-09-20T13:35Z (see notifications 20230919-AL-004 and 20230919-AL-005).\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"FLR","messageID":"20230920-AL-002","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/27013/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-09-20T14:37Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - M8.2 Flare\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-09-20T14:37:45Z\n## Message ID: 20230920-AL-002\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A.

The highest value of Kp=5.67 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-09-12T15:00Z-18:00Z. This was associated with the interplanetary shock detected at L1 by DSCOVR and ACE at 2023-09-12T10:18Z which may have been associated with the arrival of a CME not detected in available coronagraph imagery (see notification 20230912-AL-002). This arrival also caused a magnetospheric compression with simulations indicating that the magnetopause separating magnetospheric and solar wind plasma was close to the geosynchronous orbit starting at 2023-09-12T13:46Z (see notifications 20230912-AL-001 and 20230912-AL-003).\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the entire reporting period.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were at near background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to minor this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-09-07  18:58:00  19:24:00  19:09:00   M2.1   N20E55 ( 13425 ) \n2023-09-11  01:08:00  01:57:00  01:28:00   M1.3   N10E63 ( 13429 ) \n2023-09-11  03:58:00  04:15:00  04:07:00   M1.1   S08E58 ( 13431 ) \n2023-09-11  14:38:00  14:59:00  14:49:00   M1.1   S07E52 ( 13431 ) \n2023-09-12  04:18:00  04:31:00  04:26:00   M1.9   N22E02 ( 13425 )\n2023-09-12  04:31:00  04:47:00  04:42:00   M1.8   N22E02 ( 13425 )\n2023-09-12  06:47:00  07:19:00  07:07:00   M2.5   N16W34 ( 13423 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-09-07T19:24Z     ~849            C               -56/28                33                          SOHO                              \n2023-09-11T01:48Z     ~624            C               -58/27                46                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-09-07T21:12Z     ~722            C               -55/26                24                          SOHO                              \n2023-09-08T11:48Z     ~1642           O               174/8                 45                          SOHO                              \n2023-09-08T17:24Z     ~539            C              NONE(POS)/58           28                          SOHO \n2023-09-10T11:48Z     ~629            C              -110/33                12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-10T17:24Z     ~704            C               140/20                47                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-11T11:00Z     ~679            C              -175/-26               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-11T23:12Z     ~1716           O              -170/10                46                          SOHO\n2023-09-12T01:48Z     ~821            C              NONE(POS)/60           10                          SOHO   \n2023-09-12T03:24Z     ~927            C              NONE(POS)/59           10                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-09-12T05:24Z     ~729            C              NONE(POS)/52           23                          SOHO, STEREO A                              \n2023-09-12T10:36Z     ~521            C               -90/37                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-09-13T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2023-09-19T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor to moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently six numbered Active Regions on the solar disk. Active Region 13425 (N25W25) produced three M-class flares and Active Region 13423 (N16W50) produced one M-class flare during the reporting period. Both Active Regions may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity during the outlook period. Additionally, an unnumbered Active Region beyond the eastern limb might have produced notable far-sided CME activity during the reporting period and it is possible this active region could rotate onto the Earth-facing disk during the latter part of the outlook period.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the outlook period. Observed coronal hole structures centered around S25W50 and N05W25 (as seen in the available EUV imagery from SDO AIA) may become geoeffective starting on or around 2023-09-14 and 2023-09-16, respectively.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230912-AL-007","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/26904/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-09-12T21:03Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME update (Lucy, Mars, Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-09-12T21:03:25Z\n## Message ID: 20230912-AL-007\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

The arrival signature is still under analysis. \n\nAdditionally, it was estimated that the O-type CME first visible in SOHO imagery at 2023-09-01T03:24Z may reach NASA missions near Earth at 2023-09-03T15:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 2-4 (below minor) (see notifications 20230901-AL-005, 20230901-AL-007, 20230901-AL-008, and 20230902-AL-001). An ensemble simulation was performed for this CME with 24 members which estimated the CME to reach NASA missions near Earth between 2023-09-02T18:53Z and 2023-09-03T09:06Z (average arrival 2023-09-03T02:47Z) for 91% of simulations. The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there was a 73% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 3-5 range (below minor to minor). Full details of the modeled event are available here: https://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-09-01_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA042/Detailed_results_20230901_032400_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA042.txt (see notification 20230902-AL-001). The arrival of this CME has not been detected at L1. \n\nFurthermore, it was estimated that the C-type CME first visible in SOHO imagery at 2023-09-01T23:12Z may have a glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth at 2023-09-05T12:30Z (plus minus 7 hours) with a maximum estimated Kp index of 2-3 (below minor) (see notification 20230902-AL-002). The arrival of this CME may have been detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 around 2023-09-05T14:38Z (see notification 20230905-AL-003) and at STEREO A around 2023-09-05T10:50Z. \n\nIt was also estimated that the following CMEs would impact other locations:\n\nCME Starting time  | Predicted Location/Mission Impacts (plus minus 7 hours)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023-08-30T22:12Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-09-02T18:12Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2023-09-01T12:41Z, and STEREO A at 2023-09-02T09:34Z (see notification 20230831-AL-001)\n2023-09-01T03:24Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-09-03T22:00Z (glancing blow), STEREO A at 2023-09-03T14:15Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2023-09-02T16:50Z, and Juno at 2023-09-13T16:00Z (minor impact) (see notification 20230901-AL-008)\n2023-09-01T23:12Z   OSIRIS-REx at 2023-09-05T18:00Z (glancing blow), STEREO A at 2023-09-05T08:00Z (glancing blow), Parker Solar Probe at 2023-09-04T01:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230902-AL-002)\n2023-09-03T00:36Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-09-05T06:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230903-AL-005)\n2023-09-03T05:24Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-09-05T06:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230903-AL-005)\n2023-09-03T09:12Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-09-05T06:00Z (glancing blow) (see notification 20230903-AL-005)\n2023-09-05T14:00Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-09-06T21:56Z (see notification 20230905-AL-004)\n2023-09-05T20:36Z   Solar Orbiter at 2023-09-07T01:00Z (see notification 20230906-AL-001)\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at moderate levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5.67 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5.67 occurred during the synoptic period 2023-09-03T00:00Z-03:00Z. This enhancement of geomagnetic activity was likely caused by the combined arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream on 2023-09-01 with possibly the CME first visible in coronagraph imagery at 2023-08-30T22:12Z and/or 2023-09-01T03:24Z (see notifications 20230903-AL-001 and 20230903-AL-002). \n\nThe >2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt initially crossed the threshold of 1000 pfu at 2023-09-05T15:25Z and has remained elevated throughout the reporting period (see notifications 20230905-AL-001 and 20230905-AL-002). These elevated energetic electron flux levels are likely caused by the coronal hole high speed stream and/or CMEs arrivals mentioned above (see notifications 20230831-AL-001 and 20230901-AL-009).\n\nAdditionally, there was a solar energetic particle event detected by SOHO, GOES, and STEREO A. At GOES, the flux of > 10 MeV protons exceeded 10 pfu starting at 2023-09-01T04:30Z (see notifications 20230901-AL-002 and 20230901-AL-003). At STEREO A, the flux of 13-100 MeV protons exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-09-01T04:34Z (see notification 20230901-AL-004). Finally, at SOHO, the flux of the 15.8-39.8 MeV protons channel and the flux of the 28.2-50.1 MeV protons channel exceeded 10^(-1) pfu/MeV starting at 2023-09-01T05:05Z (see notification 20230901-AL-006). This solar energetic particle event was associated with a long-duration M1.2-class flare which peaked at 2023-09-01T03:52Z from Active Region 13413 and subsequent O-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 coronagraph imagery at 2023-09-01T03:24Z (see notifications 20230901-AL-005, 20230901-AL-007, 20230901-AL-008, 20230902-AL-001). The particle environment is currently near-background levels at all locations. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been high this week due to the solar energetic particle events detected at SOHO, GOES, and STEREO A, and the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \n2023-09-01  03:26:00  04:06:00  03:52:00   M1.2   N09W70 ( 13413 ) \n2023-09-02  06:33:00  07:38:00  07:12:00   M3.3   N06W89 ( 13413 ) \n2023-09-03  00:14:00  00:33:00  00:23:00   M1.1   N12W90 ( 13413 ) \n2023-09-03  08:09:00  08:49:00  08:36:00   M6.0   N12W90 ( 13413 ) \n2023-09-05  08:03:00  08:24:00  08:12:00   M2.0   N14W02 ( 13421 ) \n2023-09-05  19:33:00  19:57:00  19:45:00   M1.2   N15W07 ( 13421 )\n2023-09-05  23:21:00  23:53:00  23:39:00   M1.0   N15W12 ( 13421 ) \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-08-30T22:12Z     ~729            C                -7/6                 45                          SOHO                              \n2023-09-01T03:24Z     ~1142           O                54/22                49                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-01T23:12Z     ~581            C               -44/-14               29                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2023-08-31T02:48Z     ~693            C                50/24                13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-08-31T05:12Z     ~731            C                45/29                31                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-09-01T06:36Z     ~666            C            NONE(POS)/23             21                          SOHO\n2023-09-01T08:48Z     ~538            C            NONE(POS)/33             11                          SOHO             \n2023-09-01T22:36Z     ~833            C                76/-12               18                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-02T07:12Z     ~969            C                85/-21               29                          SOHO    \n2023-09-02T18:24Z     ~682            C            NONE(POS)/-3             24                          SOHO\n2023-09-03T00:36Z     ~652            C                89/3                 36                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-03T04:36Z     ~570            C                90/27                13                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-03T05:24Z     ~958            C               107/25                34                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-03T09:12Z     ~1334           O               104/22                39                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2023-09-04T14:09Z     ~572            C               -70/-5                20                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n2023-09-05T14:00Z     ~1053           O               126/33                49                          SOHO, STEREO A\n2023-09-05T14:36Z     ~522            C            NONE(POS)/-35            37                          SOHO              \n2023-09-05T20:36Z     ~1081           O               142/8                 57                          SOHO                              \n \n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2023-09-06T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date: 2023-09-12T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to be at moderate to high levels during the outlook period. There are currently eight numbered active regions on the solar disk. Active Region 13421 (N14W23) produced three M-class flares and may continue to exhibit notable flaring activity as it traverses the Earth-facing disk. Additionally, an unnumbered Active Region around latitude N25 will be rotating soon onto the east limb as seen in SDO and STEREO A EUV imagery.\n\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to be at minor to moderate levels during the outlook period due to increases in geomagnetic activity associated with minor coronal hole structures centered around S01E05, N32W05, and a more prominent coronal hole centered around S32E40. The first two coronal holes should cross the central meridian on 2023-09-07 and may become geoeffective starting around 2023-09-10. The more prominent coronal hole should cross the central meridian on 2023-09-09 and may become geoeffective starting around 2023-09-12.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230906-AL-001","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/26811/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-09-06T15:22Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME (Solar Orbiter)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-09-06T15:22:10Z\n## Message ID: 20230906-AL-001\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.

For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\n\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2023-09-01_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA041/Detailed_results_20230830_221205_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA041.txt\n###\n\n\n\n"},{"messageType":"CME","messageID":"20230901-AL-008","messageURL":"https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/26719/1","messageIssueTime":"2023-09-01T16:11Z","messageBody":"## Community Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information ( CCMC DONKI )\n## Message Type: Space Weather Notification - CME Update (Juno, Parker Solar Probe, STEREO A, OSIRIS-REx, Missions Near Earth)\n##\n## Message Issue Date: 2023-09-01T16:11:01Z\n## Message ID: 20230901-AL-008\n##\n## Disclaimer: NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is the United States Government official source for space weather forecasts.
