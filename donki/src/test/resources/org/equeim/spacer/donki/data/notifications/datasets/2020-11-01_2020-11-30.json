Based on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that this CME may affect Mars, OSIRIS-REx, Parker Solar Probe, and STEREO A.  The leading edge of the CME will reach Mars at 2020-12-02T22:37Z, OSIRIS-REx at 2020-11-30T19:37Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2020-11-30T19:37Z, and STEREO A at 2020-12-01T09:46Z (plus minus 7 hours). \n\nThe simulation also indicates that the CME may have a possible glancing blow at NASA missions near Earth.  Simulations indicate that the flank of the CME may reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2020-12-02T02:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 2-4 (below minor).  \n   \n\nUpdated CME parameters are (event upgraded/downgraded to O-type):\n\nStart time of the event: 2020-11-29T13:25Z.\n\nEstimated speed: ~1336 km/s.\n\nEstimated opening half-angle: 58 deg.\n\nDirection (lon./lat.): -75/-6 in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial coordinates.\n\nActivity ID: 2020-11-29T13:25:00-CME-001\n\n\nLinks to the movies of the modeled event (includes CME(s): 2020-11-29T13:25:00-CME-001):\n\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20201129_160000_2.0_anim.tim-vel.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20201129_160000_2.0_anim.tim-den.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20201129_160000_2.0_anim.tim-den-Stereo_A.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20201129_160000_2.0_anim.tim-vel-Stereo_B.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20201129_160000_2.0_anim.tim-vel-Stereo_A.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20201129_160000_2.0_anim.tim-den-Stereo_B.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20201129_160000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20201129_160000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_STB_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20201129_160000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_STA_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20201129_160000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_PSP_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20201129_160000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_Mars_timeline.gif\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20201129_160000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_Osiris_timeline.gif\n\n\n## Notes: \n\nThis CME event (2020-11-29T13:25:00-CME-001) is associated with M4.4 flare with ID 2020-11-29T12:34:00-FLR-001 which peaked at 2020-11-29T13:11Z and SEP at STEREO A with ID 2020-11-30T04:26:00-SEP-001 (see notification(s) 20201130-AL-001, 20201130-AL-002).\n\n\nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

This \"Experimental Research Information\" consists of preliminary NASA research products and should be interpreted and used accordingly.\n\n\n## Summary:\n\nSolar activity was elevated above background levels during this reporting period. There were 2 O-type CMEs, 2 C-type CMEs, and one notable S-type CME observed (see details below). \n\nBased on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the O-type CMEs first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 coronagraph imagery at 2020-11-20T19:51Z and 2020-11-20T21:12Z may reach STEREO A at 2020-11-23T04:48Z and Mars at 2020-11-24T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20201121-AL-001). It is also estimated that the C-type CME first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 coronagraph imagery at 2020-11-24T13:24Z may reach Parker Solar Probe at 2020-11-26T18:57Z and OSIRIS-REx at 2020-11-27T18:01Z (plus minus 7 hours) (see notification 20201124-AL-002).\n\nBased on preliminary heliospheric modeling carried out at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center, it is estimated that the S-type CME (<500 km/s) first observed in SOHO LASCO C2 coronagraph imagery at 2020-11-22T01:36Z may have a minor impact at Earth at 2020-11-26T16:00Z (plus minus 7 hours).\n\nGeomagnetic activity was at minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=5 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=5 occurred during the synoptic period of 2020-11-22T12:00Z-15:00Z. This Kp value is associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 on 2020-11-21.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt crossed the threshold level of 1000 pfu starting at 2020-11-22T16:40Z and stayed elevated for the remainder of the reporting period (see notifications 20201122-AL-001, 20201122-AL-002, and 20201124-AL-001). These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES are associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected at L1 on 2020-11-21.\n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate during the reporting period due to the radiation belt enhancement mentioned above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2020-11-19T03:12Z     ~523            C               -43/17                15                          SOHO                              \n2020-11-20T19:51Z     ~1166           O               -39/3                 16                          SOHO                              \n2020-11-20T21:12Z     ~1182           O               -37/3                 13                          SOHO                              \n2020-11-24T13:24Z     ~878            C              -148/-10               42                          STEREO A, SOHO                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-11-25T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-12-01T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the outlook period.

There were no significant flares or CMEs.    \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest value of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic period of 2020-10-29T15:00Z-18:00Z.  \n\nAn S-type (<500 km/s) CME that was first seen in the coronagraphs at 2020-10-23T22:35Z arrived at STEREO A around 2020-10-28T06:47Z as detected by the STEREO A IMPACT instrument. An S-type (<500 km/s) CME that was first seen in the coronagraphs at 2020-10-27T03:39Z arrived at L1 around 2020-11-01T08:41Z as detected by DSCOVR.\n\nThe > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained above the threshold level of 1000 pfu for the first half of the reporting period (see notifications 20201029-AL-001 and 20201031-AL-001). These significantly elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt detected by GOES were associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2020-10-23. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this week due to the elevated energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed\n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2020-11-04T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2020-11-10T23:59Z\n\nSolar activity is expected to vary between low and minor levels during the upcoming week. Active regions 12780 and 12781 are expected to remain visible on the Earth-facing disk throughout the outlook period. The > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES is currently elevated above background levels and a continual enhancement may be observed. Geomagnetic activity is expected to vary between low and moderate levels during the upcoming week. A few southern mid-latitude coronal hole structures visible in the available EUV imagery from SDO may become geoeffective as early as 2020-11-05.\n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center/Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
