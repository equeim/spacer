There were 2 C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period.  The highest values of Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2017-01-18T15:00Z to 2017-01-19T03:00Z.  This small enhancement in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival detected by DSCOVR at L1 of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-01-18.  The solar wind speed reached values of ~650 km/s on 2017-01-19.  \n\nThe IMPACT/PLASTIC instruments at STEREO A detected the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream around 2017-01-20.  The solar wind speed reached values >700 km/s on 2017-01-22.  \n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES were elevated at the beginning of the reporting period due to the coronal hole high speed stream described above, but remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2017-01-21T05:00Z     ~531            C               129/16                31                          SOHO                              \n2017-01-24T17:00Z     ~539            C               100/10                22                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-01-25T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-01-31T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be very low for the next reporting period.

There were two C-type CMEs (see details below).   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with a Kp index of (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The geomagnetic Kp index reached level 4 (below minor) during the synoptic period 2017-01-01T00:00Z to 2017-01-01T03:00Z. This slight elevation in geomagnetic activity was associated with a high speed stream arriving at the DSCOVR spacecraft at L1 around 2016-12-31. The maximum value of solar wind speed reached ~580 km/s on 2017-01-01.  The solar wind decreased before increasing again to ~500 km/s on 2017-01-03 and 2017-01-04.\n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES was elevated but remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\nEarth directed:\nNone Observed\n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \n2016-12-31T01:39Z     ~558            C              -104/34                15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \n2017-01-03T03:12Z     ~645            C              -105/-10               20                          SOHO                              \n \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2017-01-04T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2017-01-10T23:59Z\n\nThe solar and geomagnetic activity is expected to be moderate for the upcoming week.  The current solar wind high speed stream is expected to reach speeds of up to ~700 km/s on 2017-01-06 and could lead to minor/moderate geomagnetic activity. The active regions in the field view of SDO (Earth-facing solar disk) and STEREO A (farside of the sun) are sparse and relatively simple in complexity. The likelihood of solar eruptions is low. \n\n## Notes: \nSCORE CME typification system:\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\nhttp://swc.gsfc.nasa.gov/main/score\n\n\nNASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center ( SWRC, http://swrc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) Disclaimer\n\nData and/or information from the NASA GSFC Space Weather Research Center is provided \"as is\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.
