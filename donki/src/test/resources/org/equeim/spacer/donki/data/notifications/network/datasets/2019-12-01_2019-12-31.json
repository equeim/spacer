There were no significant flares or CMEs.   \n\nGeomagnetic activity was at below minor levels with Kp index (a measure of geomagnetic activity, ranging 0-9) <=4 for the reporting period. The highest Kp=4 occurred during the synoptic periods of 2019-12-18T12:00Z to 2019-12-18T18:00Z and 2019-12-19T03:00Z to 2019-12-19T09:00Z.  This slight increase in geomagnetic activity was associated with the arrival of a coronal hole high speed stream detected by ACE at L1 around 2019-12-18.  Solar wind speed reached values of ~570 km/s on 2019-12-18.\n\nThe > 0.8 MeV energetic electron flux detected at GOES remained below the threshold level of 10^5 pfu for the entire reporting period. \n\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \n\nSpace Weather Impact:\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low this week.\n\n##Events:\nFlares (M-class and above)\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \nNone Observed \n\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\n\nEarth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\nNon-Earth directed:\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \nNone Observed  \n\n## Space Weather Outlook:\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2019-12-25T00:00Z \n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2019-12-31T23:59Z\n\nThe solar activity is expected to be low for the upcoming week.
